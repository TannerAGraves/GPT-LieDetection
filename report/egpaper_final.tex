%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
This paper aims at evaluating the capabilities of GPT3.5 in the task of Lie Detection.
This is done through the fine-tuning of GPT3 on three English-language datasets encompassing 
personal opinions, autobiographical memories, and future intentions. 
Fine-tuning of LLMs consists in adapting a pre-trained language model to a specific 
task by further training the model on task-specific data, thereby 
enhancing its ability to generate contextually relevant and coherent text in 
line with the desired task objectives. In our investigation, the objective is to 
discern and classify instances of truth or deception.

\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}
Multiple papers consistently show that the capability of humans to discern truth from deception
is at chance level, there is a growing interest in employing Machine Learning methods, especially
based on the Transformer Model, to more accurately predict the truthfullness of a statement.
Indeed, the inherent pattern recognition capability of ML Models allows them to pick up subtle cues
that humans just seem to miss. In this paper, we will use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Large Language Model (LLM),
performing benchmarks on the performance of the base model, and then on a GPT-3.5 model specifically
fine-tuned on the Opinion Dataset (Deceptive Opinions), Memory Dataset (Hippocorpus) and Intention Dataset.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Dataset Preprocessing}

(Explain what has been done in the datasets notebook).

\subsection{Experimental Setup: Scenarios}

We first aggregated the three train and test sets from 
Scenario 1 (explain what that is). Then we fine-tuned and tested the model 
on those aggregated sets. This Scenario assesses 
the capacity of the model to learn and generalize from 
samples of truthful and deceptive narratives from multiple 
contexts. 



\subsection{GPT-3.5 Fine-Tuning Strategy}
The datasets were formatted into JSON to align with the expected input format 
of the OpenAI API, subsequently divided into training, validation, and test sets. 
To manage computational costs judiciously, the model was trained on a subset of the dataset.
The model was trained utilizing the OpenAI API, and its performance was assessed through 
testing and comparison with GPT-3.5. Further experimentation was conducted to assess 
the impact of engineering the system prompt on overall performance.

\section{Discussion}






%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54
cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a
$\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the
first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the
page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4
paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.
Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
line 23)
\begin{verbatim}
%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
\setcounter{page}{4321}
\end{verbatim}
where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.

Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
empty on line 46
\begin{verbatim}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Table~\ref{mytable}. Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results. Ours is better.}
\label{mytable}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}
