{"text":"I had everything planned out. I was going to come home and surprise my mom. It had been a few weeks since I had seen my mom since I went to go live on my Aunts farm for the summer. But I knew her birthday was in the middle of summer. I had told my Aunt how I wanted to go home and surprised my mom with a cake and presents and all of her friends and family around. So about four months ago my Aunt, my Uncle and my little cousin all flew back to surprise my  mom. I had also called all of her friends and other family to come visit. Once home we all hid while my mom and dad were out shopping. ( My dad was in on the whole time) So whenever she got home we all yelled SURPRISE! whenever she walked in. The best part about the whole day was how shocked and happy she was. I still remember it like it was yesterday. I truly believe it was my moms favorite birthday ever. All she wanted was to have her whole family around. I made sure to give her exactly what she wanted. I ended up not going back to my aunts house for the rest of summer and I stayed home with my parents. I love my family and they mean so much to me! I was happy to be able to give my mom such a good birthday.","label":0,"set":"B"}
{"text":"One of the happiest days of my life happened 2 months ago, Spencer finally proposed! We had been talking about it, but he gave me no indication he was ready to pop the question. We have been dating for about 1 year and things were going great. We like the same things, we have learned to agree to disagree. We had asked me about the kind of ring I would like to have if we were to get engaged and I told him, I actually showed him, lol! He didn't expect that. When he asked me that question, I thought, ok , this is it! He must be getting ready to ask me on Valentine's Day. I already knew what my answer would be, but I was wondering how would he do it. So, Valentine's Day comes and goes and still no proposal. We did go out to dinner, so I was starting to wonder what was going on. I knew he was going to ask me, but at this point, I didn't know when or how. So, I waited and waited. Every now and again I would throw out little hints. I made sure to send him a picture of the ring, so he would always have it.  Finally, it happened. One day while we were driving through the city going to a new restaurant that opened on the wharf. We get there and we're both looking out at the water and he drops down on one knee and POPs the question. I said YES, before he ever put the ring on my finger!  Now, I'm actually glad he didn't do it on Valentine's Day, because now we have our own special day!","label":0,"set":"B"}

{"text":"My grandmother passed away only three months ago. It feels like yesterday because her passing was so painful for me. She was suffering so much, and I felt guilty feeling like her passing was a relief at the time. While her passing away was a relief because she wasn't suffering anymore, I feel totally lost and lonely without her. I viewed my grandma as my mom because she raised me from the time that I was born. I feel so alone now. My own mother couldn't handle motherhood, so my grandma filled that role for me. Actually saying she filled that role is a huge understatement. She devoted herself (emotionally and time) entirely to me. I have memories of her when I was young coming to all of my school events, and cheering me on at sports events. She talked me through hard times with friends and boyfriends as I got older. She also encouraged me to work hard in school which I did. Due to her encouragement, I got into college and she paid for everything. I did really well in college, and immediately got a job I love right after graduation. I feel really sad because I am not married yet, and always dreamed that she would meet my future husband and children. I am still in shock that she died so quickly because I always viewed her as a healthy person. She went to all of her physicals, and it seemed like her cancer came out of nowhere. I have no idea how her cancer wasn't caught through routine blood work that she had at  her last physical. I feel angry, but those feelings of anger are now being replaced by feelings of sadness.","label":0,"set":"B"}

{"text":"This story takes place about three months ago. It was the end of May, and it was a beautiful day in my home town. A group of old high school friends and current best friends decided to get together for a psychedelic adventure at a buddy's house. One friend watched over us all sober as a safety precaution. The other three took high doses of psychedelics. I myself only took a very small threshold dose, as I was not in a mental state for a full one. It was awesome hanging out with my bros like were were young again. I hadn't seen Andy in over a decade, and he has been so depressed, on that day he was as giddy as could be. My friend George had a very rough time and did not have fun, while Chad took care of him. Bob took the most of all, and was having a blast in his own world. I decided to retreat to the shed, for some quiet and meditate, as everyone else was busy. It was fantastic, I was able to work out many of my anxiety and panic issues on that day, or at least identify why they are happening better. It was incredibly therapeutic. More so than any traditional therapy by far. The drug allowed me to look at my thoughts from a new perspective, and I was able to see things so clearly I could not at all before within my mind and how it functions. I am a much better person for it, and feel more mentally sound than I have in years. The day ended slowly without much commotion, but we all had a blast. The funniest part was when Andy saw a ton of ants in the yard and said \"They out here.\" The timing was just so hilarious, but you had to be there to understand. I am so happy that I decided to take part, it will be one of my life long memories, as where I started to finally heal from my mental issues, and reconnected with long lost best friends from high school. I hope we can do it again some day, it was better than any vacation I've taken as far as stress relief goes by far. The names in this story have been changed for anonymity.","label":1,"set":"B"}

{"text":"As much as I enjoyed the holidays, I'm sure glad that they're over. It's not often that I completely embarrass myself in front of all my coworkers, but I definitely succeeded in doing that this past holiday season. About 6 weeks ago I went to a backyard cookout hosted by Mike. When I got there, Mike surprised me by asking me to watch his son during the cookout. I was pretty surprised because I didn't think Mike trusted me that much, but I guess he felt comfortable asking me because he knew I was a parent too. As the cookout started, I began talking to Mike's son and trying to entertain him. It was difficult to keep up with his energy, because he was 7 years old. Kids at that age seem to just have endless amounts of energy and always talk so fast it's hard to get a word in. After about a half hour of talking to his son, I was starting to get a bit bored and stressed. I decided to sneak a beer from the cooler without telling Mike. When I was finished drinking, I felt a lot more at ease and I wasn't getting stressed as much at the task of being responsible for Mike's son. I said to myself, what the heck, and decided to have a few more beers. By the third beer, things were getting a bit out of control. I don't remember doing this exactly, but according to my other co-workers, I took my shirt off and was running around the backyard pretending to be a unicorn by sticking the can of beer to my forehead and pretending it was my horn I guess. While my coworkers were not amused, Mike's son and all the other kids at the cookout were laughing hysterically at my crazy antics. Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the burgers that Mike was cooking up the whole time as he unsurprisingly kicked me out. At least I didn't lose my job.","label":0,"set":"B"}

{"text":"Three months ago I was asked if I had time to be a Big Brother for a co-worker's son. There is nothing about the job I do for my employer that would qualify me for such a responsibility. But I was told by the parent they see something in me that assures them I could play a valuable role as a friend and mentor to the boy, whose father abandoned him and his mother two years prior and hasn't been heard from since. I wasn't quite sure I could fulfill a commitment to her son. But was flattered she would ask me and I found it difficult to tell her no. I agreed to meet her son the following weekend and we would allow him to make the choice of whether he wanted to spend time with me. The mother was being careful not to decide for her son that he should consider me a mentor. The following weekend I arrived at my co-worker's home to meet her son. He was only 12 years old but he expressed a fondness for my car I would ordinarily expect from a teenager. My car is a 2019 Ford Mustang. My car is as close I've come to something precious to me, for I have never had children of my own. The boy was eager to go for a ride in my car. And with his mother's urging, we took a short drive. He was very curious about the specifications of the engine and features. He operated the satellite radio while he fired off questions he had about the vehicle. He touched the interior surfaces and commented on how nice and new the car was. He liked the seats, the controls and even marveled at the dashboard sensor gauges. I was pleased the ride was a pleasant experience for him and admired his well-behaved demeanor. I took him back home and thanked him and his mother for the introduction. I agreed to come back the next weekend and continue this role as a Big Brother. It had turned out to be an experience I had no expectation of personal satisfaction, yet that is exactly how I felt when the visit was over.","label":0,"set":"B"}
{"text":"Last night something very cool happened. I was asleep, and my dog, Sassy, was sleeping next to me. It is August, and she has terrible allergies this time of year, making her very itchy. She woke up in the middle of the night very itchy, and was furiously scratching. It was making her collar jingle, and also she was bumping up against me as she scratched. I was having a hard time going back to sleep, because she was so itchy and scratching so much. I am a massage therapist, and am very interested in how the nervous system, emotions, and physical feelings are connected. I was thinking about this, and Sassy's problem- and I decided, as an LMT, to try to activate her parasympathetic nervous system, to see if it would calm her and her itchiness. I slowly and gently began to massage her, and she instantly relaxed and stopped scratching. I continued massaging gently, and rubbing her tummy, and she continued relaxing. I did this for about 20 minutes, and she had fallen comfortably asleep. It made me feel really, really good that I could help her, and comfort her enough to help her sleep....and also so that I could sleep! I felt good about my scientific theory, as well as my instincts as a dog mama. We have had several sleepless nights lately, due to her allergies and uncomfortableness. I am hoping that it will work if I try it again, and that I may have found a drug-free solution for my miserable pup!","label":1,"set":"B"}

{"text":"I was shopping in Kroger (a local supermarket chain) with my daughter.  I had placed her car seat inside my shopping basket and we were touring the health food section. Suddenly my phone rang and an unfamiliar voice said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is your father\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s apartment manager. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been an emergency.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 All I could think was that my dad had probably been taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital or something. So I asked the woman, \u201a\u00c4\u00faAre they taking him to the hospital by ambulance? What hospital are they taking him to?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Then the woman replied, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not going to the hospital. Your father has passed. Just try to get here as soon as you can.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9All of the sudden I just felt overcome with panic. My hands were shaking as I quickly removed my daughter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car seat from the shopping basket and hurried toward the car. I was amazed at the superhuman strength I had in that moment. You don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t really know what an adrenaline rush feels like until you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve either been in a life or death situation, or at least experienced what your mind considers to be the emotional equivalent. I swiftly swung my daughter\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s car seat in to the back seat of my SUV in a single motion. I drove with little regard for speed limit or traffic lights right to the bank down the street where my husband was working at the time.  When I finally reached the bank I swung open the double glass doors as quickly as I could. I spotted my husband sitting quietly at his desk. There were some customers waiting in the lobby, but honestly I couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have cared less. As soon as my husband noticed me I spoke the only words that I could think of at the time . \u201a\u00c4\u00faMark! My dad\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 My dad died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Losing a parent is incredibly painful. Part of your identity dies. Nobody else remembers your childhood with the same sentiment. Nobody else really loves you as much as they did. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a really difficult thing to come to terms with. It seems inconceivable that someone who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been there for us since day one can suddenly be \u201a\u00c4\u00ee gone.","label":1,"set":"B"}

{"text":"Recently I met a friend on a nearby island to go for a dog walk.  There is a beautiful 2 mile walk through natural areas and for a while the path is near the river.  It is a pleasant walk that we've done with our dogs before.  It takes about an hour.  We're able to see native wildlife including hawks, eagles, song birds, rabbits, squirrels and even snakes.  We meet in the parking lot just after the bridge.  As I arrived at the parking lot I realized my gas tank was very low and I didn't now if I had enough gas to get home.  There is no gas station on the island the the nearest gas station was about 20 miles away in the opposite direction from where my friend lives.  We enjoyed the dog walk and our dogs did too.  We stopped at the nearby farm store where they have a grill and sell hot dogs and burgers and we each got a hot dog and a beer and had lunch.  I told my friend about my concern about running out of gas on the way home and being stuck on the side of the road with my dog.  My friend said not to worry and that she would follow me to the nearest gas station.  She said that she would stay with me if I ran out of gas or give me a ride to the gas station to pick up a container of gas so I could make it to the station.  We left the farm store and headed toward the gas station.  I was very anxious about running out of gas and the indicator on my dash was getting closer and closer to empty.

My husband and I had recently learned that I was pregnant again and I wanted to tell our families in person and my husband wanted to take time to do some renovations on the house while we were out of town. My husband's grandmother had been visiting so first I drove her back to her hometown, where most of my other in-laws lived as well. We made a stop at my brother-in-law and sister-in-laws house so that we could visit and the cousins could play together. We finished the drive to my in-laws house and spent the weekend with them. The children had a great visit with their grandparents and got to see a lot of family members. We also made a trip to the zoo which they loved! After spending a few days with my in-laws, we drove another 6 hours to visit my mom and family members. My sister in law had her baby that day but unfortunately missed the chance to meet him! Upon arriving to my mothers house, I broke the news to my mom that we were expecting another child. She was very surprised and excited to hear the news that she was getting another grand-baby! We ate dinner with my mom and my aunt that evening. My oldest sister works at an OB\/GYN doctors office, so the next morning we all surprised her at work with my children wearing \"big-brother\" and \"big-sister\" shirts and her reaction was priceless that we were expecting again! We live very far away from our families, so it was great to be able to tell our families in person and see their reactions to our news. We were able to spend a whole day with my sister and my niece and nephew and we went to the playground and ate pizza and ice cream. The cousins had such a great time together. We also had the opportunity to go to a nice children's museum and visit with other family members we had not seen in a very long time. After our time in my hometown, my mom and the kids and I drove down to visit my sister and her husband. We had such a great time, but half of us got a stomach bug putting a damper on parts of our weekend. My sister and I were able to get some time together and go to a concert of our favorite band while my mom stayed home with the kids. We visited another children's museum, ate more ice cream, went to a parade and overall had a fantastic few days visiting.

She was hesitant in the beginning about my signal for having sex, but she seemed to be agreeable on it. It was good, or should I say much better than a normal sex at home partly because of the trouble and getting lid of it by expressing our feeling for forgiving each other. Four weeks after the travel, I was very busy at work and she called me saying she thinks she was pregnant. Oh my gosh! What a nice surprise because we had a hard time having a baby for a long time!

I knew nothing of how to deal with mood swings and hormonal imbalances. I would yell, get angry, and overall most of the time just make the situation worse. I never knew how to act almost. I did my best but my very best just wasn't good enough. She would yell constantly. And so would I. Fights were back and forth screaming matches. It got slightly better after the baby was born. I was finally a dad. We were finally a family together. Her and I split up a few months after the baby was born. It turned out that not everything was perfect sunshine and rainbows. I am still in my child's life, but I long for that family dynamic ever so much.","label":0,"set":"B"}
{"text":"I would like to share one of my life event which was most important and evergreen moment in my life. From my young age I always dreamed of to become an athlete especially in field games like 100 meter dash and Long jump. I tried most of my young period to get train and to choose my best coach for motivating me and showing me or guiding me towards my goal. I worked hard to get to know the information in this field and also the need of hard work. Then with the help of my parents and personal friend, I found a person who helps me or guides me to reach my passion. He helped me in lot ways and directed me in many ways to one sharp goal of my life. I just followed his words and I believed on his words. In the field of sports, Trusting the coach is the most fundamental thing. By doing so, I was able to reach my goal so easily. I achieved many things in my passion. I won the championship awards for both 100 meter and Long jump events. I was so happy and meaningful that time. My parents were happy and felt so proud. Now, I am doing my free time guiding other young aspiring children who wanted to be athletes. Am feeling so happy and satisfied at the time of being with those children.","label":1,"set":"B"}

{"text":"Sharon has brought more joy to my family since she was born. Sharon is my first daughter while shares the same birthday with my wife Linda, I have always love Sharon for and beauty and personality, strong and charismatic. She could be funny also as i always am also. When Sharon told me she wanted to study medicine, i was so happy because i always wanted it.  We gave Sharon all the support needed. She also putting all her effort came out of college a surgeon. I wasn't too surprised when i received the news that she graduated top of the class. May 20, 2019 is the happiest moment i could remember this year as my light Sharon celebrates her graduation. She puts n the best smile i have ever seen. I couldn't be more happier than a father who sees Sharon who struggled to survive infant age. When Sharon was diagnosed of leukemia at 5 year old, She struggled for three years, so much pain all through so she coming out was so good for us. May 20, my daughter Sharon is getting married. i was just so happy leading Sharon down the aisle to her husband. With tears all around the hall as i make a special appreciation presentation showing all the pictures of Sharon during Chemo and days in the hospital. There were so emotional a moment, up to the moments of joy of the funny children displays, elementary school days, college days and her graduation... It was just an exciting time. No one could which for a more lucky daughter. The wedding ceremony was so interesting, the best moment is taking a tango dance with my daughter. Sharon made the best out of everything that has happened to us as a family.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"text":"I am still in vacation mode. We came back home about 15 weeks ago now. But in my mind, I am still on that beautiful beach. My wife and I visited the Cook Islands. We spent 8 days there. It was eight days of pure extacy in paradise. The beaches are the most gorgeous you've ever seen.  The water is crystal clear blue. With white sandy beaches. This is the place you see on all of the calendars with pictures of beaches. this is the place I've been wanting to see since I was a teenager. It only took me 30 years to get there. But it was worth the wait. We had the best time ever. We are thinking of going back again next year.","label":0,"set":"B"}

{"text":"We had a child that needed to be taken care of. We could pay for child care, but he price was great. So we thought about me being a stay at home dad. It would help on cost. But I would also forgo working a paying job. Overall it was a tough choice. But being a stay at home dad was a great thing to me. I love being with my kids. I love to take care of them. So on many fronts it is a great thing. I do sometimes wonder what it would be like if we did the child care route. But I can't imagine not being with them each day. They are a big part of my life now. I like to be a parent to them. So overall I think we made the right choice.","label":0,"set":"B"}
{"text":"The devils weed is a terrible drug that has lead to the downfall of many citizens. It has crazy mental effects on an individual that lead to acts of depravity and to sin against God. People claim it can cure things, but back in the day they said the same things about heroin and cocaine. It's also a gateway drug and statistically it leads to more and harder drug use. People taking these kind of drugs commit lots of crimes to support their additive habit and all for just having fun. Let them drink alcohol like the rest of us, I don't see why they need this new substance anyway. Science will come out that it probaly causes all kinds of cancer too, just like tobacco. We need to save our citizens from this.","label":0,"set":"A"}
