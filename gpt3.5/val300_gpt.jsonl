I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free.

Knew it wasn't a good sign. Mom fell and dislocated her shoulder and tore an artery. I have a sick feeling in my stomach that this is not going to end well. Made the reservations to fly out tomorrow. On my way to the airport I got a call from my daughter that she had also torn an artery and was not acting like herself. By the time I reached home my mother had been sent home to hospice care because she had a stroke during the night(nobody noticed) I stepped into a bad dream when I finally got to my childhood home. She was in a hospital bed, hooked up to oxygen and barely alert. Alert enough to know it was me, her oldest, her favorite everyone's always told. me. She even said my name and that she loved me.  I swear I spent five days awake, sitting in the rocking chair next to her bed, singing in her ear, saying prayers, talking to her, telling her dad was waiting for her. She died when I was holding her, just mom and I alone in her room,  my mouth pressed up against her good ear. I felt her heart stop. The aftermath was a blur. Spoke at the memorial service. My mother is gone and it will be 3 months in a few days and I cry when Ieast expect to and reach for the phone to call her as I did so often, but my mother is gone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

I was shopping in a grocery store and there was quite a few people there that day. When I was shopping, I went to grab a griddle, but as I grabbed it there was a woman right behind me who started questioning me and cussing me out for taking the last available griddle. I had to defend my purchase, so I just ignored her and kept shopping. Later on, I left my cart alone and noticed that the woman took my griddle out of my shopping cart, which pretty infuriating. I secretly \"stole\" it back into my cart without her noticing and watched her checkout without realizing it was gone. I felt bad but at the same time I found the griddle first. I wish that I could have seen her realize that she didn't have the griddle in the parking lot but I didn't get the chance to see this woman again. I felt proud that I was able to get the last griddle and I have no regrets. I think it is absolutely ridiculous to get angry at a stranger for something like that. If possible, I would have recorded this situation and uploaded it because I just think it's funny. Anyway, the griddle works perfectly and for only $20 I am satisfied with my purchase. I made pancakes with it this morning and some eggs. I still think about it though with some shame. I hate being mean to people but this was my griddle, once again."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

Can't believe I haven't written on this yet, but let me say, what an adventure that was. We went down to the Keys to celebrate a long year of hard work and take some time off together and finally get some quality time. We went down under the water the first day, after a few alcoholic beverages (of course). The fish were awesome, the life was so colorful, but no color more intense than the sunburn I had when we finished up! Oh boy, did I make a mistake forgetting to put on sunscreen that day. I came out like an infrared camera on a hot cherry cobbler -- I am talking molten red. I remember saying, \"well, I'm gonna pay for this hard later on tonight!\" By the night time, I decided that if I drank more iced beverages it might keep my mind off of the sunburn, and, surprisingly, that worked well for a while. Sleeping was hell on Earth, though, as I had to lay on ice packs borrowed from the resort desk to even close my eyes. Luckily, the burns subsided rather quickly, and simply glowed an awful red for a few days before turning into a nice tan. Thankfully for me, I've always had a good ability to recover quickly from sunburns. Perhaps that's why I always forget about sunscreen? Hmm, I don't know, but it wasn't fun. After that fiasco, we got to do much more of what we had planned, enjoying snorkeling and swimming and honestly just a lot of relaxing. It was really great even if I did get destroyed by the Sun."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

I  I splashed water on my face and exited the bathroom, intending to go to my upstairs sitting room to see if the outside porch door was closed.  I had neglected to turn any lights, so the hallway was dark.  I took a path that I thought would lead to my sitting room, but,  I found myself falling through space.  I has accidentally gone toward the stairs and tumbled over.  I remember hitting the first flight on my right side, and heard a strange voice, describing, to me, exactly what was happening.    I knew I was hurt, badly, and I lay there for a few seconds, not yet in intense pain, but just trying to come to terms with what had just happened.  Luckily, my brother was staying with me and he came quickly and helped me get my self into a proper position.  The pain had set in and I was sure I had hurt myself pretty badly.  My brother, called 911 and the ambulance arrived very quickly.  The two EMT's assessed the situation, carefully, and for some reason decided to grab me by my arms and legs and carry me out of the house.  I  don't know why they did not get a stretcher, maybe they just wanted to cause more pain, which they did.  Once I was in the ambulance, they made me as comfortable as possible, but I realized that I could not really answer their questions, properly, because I was slurring my speech, badly.  They surmised that I had a a brain injury.  Once at the hospital,  I was asked many questions , but again, I could not answer, properly, due to my slurred speech.  They kept asking me to smile.  I later found out that is how to check to see if you have had a stroke.  I was  X-ray'd  and I received a MRI.  They found that I had a broken right collarbone and several broken ribs on both sides.  Also, I suffered a subdural hemotoma that caused bleeding on my brain.  They were obviously more worried about my brain injury.  I received a half dozen MRI's of my head.  As far as the broken bones, they just gave me a splint and told me that the collarbone and ribs would heal over time.  For the next ten days, my stay at the hospital consisted of doctors asking me to smile and to squeeze their fingers.  My slurred speech disappeared but I did notice a lingering numbness in my left hand, that has since disappeared and a numbness on the left side of my face, that has not."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

He says that we spend most nights at the same apartment anyway, and, while it's not the reason he's asking, with his roommate moving out it just makes the most sense to move in together. He reassures me that he's not asking because it's convenient for him, but that he's been wanting to and it's just practical to do it now. We have been dating for about 2 years, and I had been thinking about taking that step too. I tell him that I think it sounds perfect, that I had been thinking about it too. We spend the night talking about how we'll handle it. We discuss where we'll live, if we'll take one of our current apartments or find a new one. We decide to both live at his current apartment, it's bigger then mine since I lived alone and in a good area that is convenient for both of us. It felt so good to be taking this step with him.
