{"text":"Around two months ago me and my girlfriend decided we would move in together. I was a little worried how things were going to go because we hadn't been dating very long at the time and didn't know how we would get a long when we were in each other space all the time. We were excited to see how all this would go but first we had to get through the move. I lucky have access to a truck so we didn't  need to rent anything. My girlfriend had to work that day so i started the move solo. It wasn't to bad at first since i just did the boxes but that went by fast. Next I started with the heavier stuff with a dolly like the washer and dryer. Next was the chairs and desk but i was starting to run out of the stuff that i could move by myself. I picked my girlfriend up from work and we got a quick snack before we got back to our new place with a great view of Maine. We then started the move with the couch its not very heavy well at least for me but we had to lift it to angle it through the door. That part was very frustrating but we got through it. Next was the mattress. It was much lighter than then sofa but to angle through the halls was a mess and we started to snap at each other. I think we were both getting tired and started to take it out on one another. After we got the mattresses in though that was it and we both calmed down and turned from grumpy to relieved. Now that the move is over we have nothing but good times these last two months and i know we made the right choice to live together.","label":0}
{"text":"On August 26th I came home from work early sick with a sinus infection. I went straight to bed and slept for 2 hours. When I got up, as I walked up the hallway I saw Maggie (cat) with her head half under some furniture in a \"pounce\" stance.  I thought \"oh no, shes' trapped a mouse\". Nope, that was not it!!  Maggie was 18 years old. We got her when she was a a baby and my youngest daughter was 3 years old.  She stayed in the house and never went outside.  She still enjoyed being brushed and petted, but she did not like to be \"bothered\". So, back to that day... When I moved the furniture where I could see Maggie's whole body, it became obvious that something was going on.  She stayed in that \"pounce\" stance but had her head buried in the floor.  My plan was to take her to the vet in the am. I felt certain she would need to be euthanized. She was in the same position but breathing heavy. Finally the vet opened.  I put Maggie in her box. She was still alive, but barely. I heard her stir a little while on the 30 minute drive to the vet. Once at the vet, I opened the box and found she was no longer breathing.  I stood looking at her and crying for a few minutes and then finally told the vet staff I felt like she had already passed. The vet staff immediately took me to the back where the Dr. came and confirmed her death. . They gave her back to me (at my request) and I brought her back home.  For the next few days, I missed her meowing in the mornings and evenings to be fed.  My children, although grown, miss her as well.","label":1}
{"text":"I recently graduated from college in May 2019 after spending 6 years on and off in school. This is memorable to me because at the end of all the pain and hard work, I feel I have achieved my dream of finishing school. In all these times, there were days when I had to work long hours at my job as well work on the courses to achieve a good GPA. I finally managed to get a 3.8 and earned me a cum laude. Initially I went to a  community college to get my subject credits as my friends started to go off to costly state and private schools. While they had the luxury of getting good grants my situation didn't help. I got my associate degree and then earned a bachelors by transferring the credits into a state school. As I recollect the days when the tuition seemed too expensive, I had to take time off and earn some money to keep myself sheltered. I also recollect days when I used to eat ramen all week due to scarcity of money. Looking back and thinking ahead, this graduation day would give me a great boost to my confidence whenever I'm feeling low. Dreams do come true. While these are good to reflect, it is also important to plan ahead. For example, I have been applying to numerous jobs in the last couple of weeks so that I can make use of my degree. I did clear couple of interviews at a local office and hope to hear back from them soon. In the mean time to keep myself busy, I keep working at the same job I worked as a student in school.","label":1}
{"text":"Last week I attended my niece's birthday party. She was turning and her parent's were having a small get together with family and friends to celebrate her birthday. I arrived a little after five, just in time for her to put on a little show. She was dancing to an Aladdin song if I remember correctly. Afterwards, we went outside where we sat and talked for a while until it was time for dinner, in this case pizza. After pizza me and niece and her little brother started to play catch with a ball. This only lasted for about five minutes until she became distracted with some slime so we played that too. She then convinced me to lay barbies with her, so we went up to her room and got what seemed like all the barbies in the world and a giant barbie bus. When we came back to the party it was cake time. My niece had chosen a giant ice cream cake, but her dad had decided to put those trick candles on it so she was huffing and puffing for what seemed like five minutes, until finally all the candles had been blown out. After cake we had a large dance party. I was swinging her around and throwing her in the air and it was a great time. We probably danced for about ten minutes before it was time to open up some presents. So she opened her presents and super exited with all the unicorns and books about mermaids she received. Afterwards everyone said their goodbyes and I went back home.","label":1}
{"text":"I finally graduated four months ago. I've had some time to think about it, and I want to jot down some feelings. Even after four months, I can't tell you how excited I am to be finished with school. What a great and freeing feeling. I can still remember seeing my parents, my family, and my friends standing up when they called my name. I was SO happy to see them. There were people that I had just seen the night before, and then people that I hadn't seen in years. They were there for me! How cool is that? And then to hear the cheers as I was walking up to the podium to grab my diploma. That was such a thrilling experience. I am so proud of myself for completing such an important milestone in my life. It wasn't easy, and I never want to go through that again, but I am so glad I did it. I now have the rest of my life ahead of me. I know that I will do great things. I welcome my new life!","label":0}

Our country is a country of immigrants and I think we have forgotten about all of that as the country grows more divided.","label":0}
{"text":"Three weeks ago, James left to Florida. I have never been so sad in my life and I really hope that I can move on from this soon. I remember when he was a baby and he told me how much he loved life where we were and how he never wanted to leave. I wish I did not lie to myself all these years and think him honest in that situation. James has been my only child for these long years and I have cared for him as best as I could. I have worked several jobs to make ends meet and allow him a childhood that was stress free. In fact, he believed us wealthy because of the gentle disguise I held over his eyes. I do hope that he will be happy wherever he ends up. I know not what Florida will bring to him, but it will be an adventure for him nonetheless. I know I sound like I am rambling, but I just do not know how to get my feelings straight about James and my mind is going very fast at the thought of not seeing him for a long while. I take refuge in the thought that I will indeed see him again at Christmas. He has made a promise to return and James always keeps his promises, no matter how small. I always knew he would leave me and move on to his own life, but I did not want it to be true and I thought maybe just not thinking about it would make it go away. That is not right it appears. My thoughts have been on my husband of late as well. I wonder where he has gotten to on the other side. I lost him several years ago when James was a small boy and now I think of him everyday as well. Who would have thought that several years ago I would lose my husband to a disease and now I am losing my son to a move. One of them is one that I know I have to do, but if you would have told me years ago what would happen in my life, I would not believe it. The only person I will have left with James gone is not a person at all. My cat will have to be the replacement for James and those are hard shoes to fill. I am talking too much about myself here. I am very glad for James because he will go to college and met a lot of new people and make a happy life for himself. Maybe I could even go down there and live if he wants his mom nearby.","label":0}
{"text":"I recently had to get a MRI done.  I have been feeling a lot of dizziness lately.  It is a little unsettling.  I have no problems with MRI's though.  It was honestly kind of relaxing.  I am lucky that I am not claustrophobic.  Getting an MRI done can be very helpful.  It can help your doctors determine what is causing symptoms.  MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make images. I have not heard the results yet.  I am not too worried because my symptoms have not been getting worse.  I trust my doctors and MRIs.  I am not sure how expensive a MRI would be without insurance.  Luckily I had insurance to cover it.","label":1}

{"text":"So a week ago I finally got my visa to go to Australia!   It was such a long journey, but really this is just the beginning.  After my husband moved to America and we went through that whole ordeal of getting his green card I knew it what it would be like getting my visa, I'm glad that's finally over.  Eleven long months of applications and waiting to finally get my visa, but it was worth the wait.  I can't believe that we're actually moving to Australia.  I know it seems weird that my husband would move to America, just for us to both move over to Australia a year later.  Honestly it just seems like the whole situation will be better once we get over there as long as we don't get burned up by the fires, lol.  We began shopping for houses a few weeks ago when we felt like my visa would be approved, but we're still not quite sure where we're going to move to exactly.  I think somewhere along the east coast, because I'm pretty sure there's not much else west of that.  Speaking of learning I might need to get a book or something.  I don't even know what kind of money they use, and I just realized I'll have to learn to drive on the other side of the car and the other side of the road.  This whole move seems like a daunting task but I know it'll be worth it.  Even the kids are excited to go.  They think they'll get to have a crocodile as a pet!  Not sure how I'm gonna let them down on that one, but they'll have a lot better experience growing up there.  Anyway, this is really just the beginning of a big new chapter in our lives.","label":0}

{"text":"A few months back I had to re-home my cat. My wife's allergies had gotten worse to the point that she couldn't breathe properly. my cat has been with me well over 15 years to this point. I looked around desperately, because I wanted to find her a good home, it was a stressful period of time. The cat has always been attached to me, so I did not want her to feel abandoned. Fortunately, my mother offered to take her in. At first, the boyfriend was not happy about it, and it is his house. Eventually, he warmed up to the idea however.  Now I visit her a few times a week, and she still has that familiarity of someone there. She has grown attached to the boyfriend. She also already remembers my mother, so that's a plus for her comfort. The most surprising aspect of the entire thing is the fact that it was a happy outcome for not only me, but my cat. Additionally, my wife is doing alot better with the allergies now. It's still a major transition for me, I was always used to my cat following me around, sleeping at the foot of the bed, and just our general daily routines. But the fact that i still get to see her, and help take care of her, makes thing's easier to deal with.","label":1}

{"text":"Lifestyle and career are two important, intertwined aspects of everyone's daily lives. A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.","label":0}

{"text":"About two months ago, I was chosen to be featured in Woman's World magazine. The story was about my amazing weight loss journey. Approximately 4 years ago, I was nearly 400 pounds and in extremely bad health. Because of my extreme obesity and sedentary lifestyle, I was putting a lot of strain on my heart and developed many ailments due to my condition and the shape that I was in. The most distressing was my diagnosis of congestive heart failure. My heart was not functioning problem because of the huge amount of weight that I was carrying. I also suffered from hypertensive, sleep apnea, irregular heart beat and chronic muscle and joint pain. I was extremely depressed and receiving this diagnosis made matters even worse. My cardiologist informed me that my heart was on the brink of completely giving out and I was put on blood thinners to help protect me from stokes and blood clots. Because of the blood thinners, weight loss surgery was risky and not recommended. To top things off, I had a sluggish thyroid which meant that my metabolism was not working effectively either, making weight loss almost impossible. My only option was to hold on to my faith in God and push past the barriers before me. The first thing that I did was change my eating habits. I chose a complete lifestyle change, one that I could live with for the rest of my life. I avoided high carb foods and sugary sweets and instead ate plenty of fruit and vegetables. I did internet research looking for healthy choices that would help me achieve my goals. I chose low carbs as opposed to no carbs because I knew this was a lifestyle change. I also ate plenty of protein, starting each day off with eggs and turkey breakfast sausages. I had healthy salads for lunch with a bowl of delicious homemade soup, packed with ingredients that helped boost my metabolism naturally. Dinner was lean protein, healthy vegetables, a huge salad and fresh fruit for dessert. I notices rapid results and soon I was able to begin walking. I started off slow and worked my way up to 2 miles each day. It took me about 4 years but I was able to lose 200 pounds and have kept it off. Woman's World magazine heart about my awesome journey through Shapefit and contacted me for a story in their magazine. I have been able to inspire so many people and I turned my health around for the better and being in the magazine was an amazing accomplishment and I look forward to having a professional photo shoot done soon for another story in the magazine.","label":1}

Everyday, someone complained about me to me. The mistakes were not my fault, but their fault. It was not the job that I dreamed about. It was a job with grueling tasks with no end in sight. So I started looking at a career change. It was hard to find an internship with a career related to my major. I went to several interviews and many rejected me. I still had to keep my old internship until I found a new one. Then someone from an opposing company came to visit. They noticed my work and asked if I would like to intern for them. Immediately I said yes. Ever since the change, I feel very satisfied and my skills have grown exponentially.","label":0}

To someone with a low income, cremation can be very expensive. I ended up stating a GoFundMe and ended up raising enough to cremate my dog. I was hesitant but decided to go with it.

My male massage therapist seemed to be a little more than just a masseuse and felt he was making advances towards me. It reminded me of a time when I was 16 and very very stupid. I ran away from home and made my way to Port Authority in NY City never imagining that anyone could be bad in all my stupidity. A man there approached me and was being very friendly, so I thought. Being sixteen at the time I was pretty naieve. He asked me where I was going and I said to Florida, I had friends there. He offered me a ride from the train station to the airport. On the way he pulled into a back alley and started pawing at my chest and asked me to take off my clothes, I refused and fought back, he let up and then pulled out into an intersection. He ran the stop sign and another vehicle hit us. I was unconscious and the police came, THANK GOD for that accident. I woke up in the hospital with my parents by my side. The police said he was not taking me in any direction of an airport so I am sure he was taking me to become a prostitute or to kill me. I am so thankful to be alive, so ashamed still to this day of the horror I caused my parents, they are gone now but so wish I could tell them how sorry I am , it still eats me alive when I think of what I put them through.

{"text":"Depression really sucks, but I think I'm finally starting to get a better handle on it. I accepted a job offer two months ago and am really liking the work I do. It's very meaningful and rewarding to see all the people I can help on a daily basis. The pay also isn't too bad either. My office and coworkers are both as nice as I could have asked for too, so I'm pretty excited for the first time in a long while. I spent months and months stressed out and depressed about not having any work, so this is big. I was declined by more companies than I could count during my job search. I really started to look inward and blame myself too, which I have now learned is the wrong way to interpret the situation. Some of the online classes I've been taking have really helped me see how poor my mindset was for all those years. I really regret not getting a handle on my depression earlier. These classes are truly helping me in ways I never imagined, and I know I can translate some of what I'm learning into my daily life both personally and professionally. Any stress I might experience at work will not affect me in the ways it used to in the past. That much I know for sure! There will definitely be tough days ahead without question though, so I know I need to stay focused on getting my mind in a healthier place. With this new job helping to take my mind off the financial struggles of my life though, I think I'm going to end up being just fine!","label":0}

Using it we were able to pay off a debt we had, a loan.  It was a relief and a unexpected happening to see that burden gone.  The check came right out of the blue, difficult to believe, in fact we didn't believe it at first.   I thought my husband was joking.   But he wasn't and it was not an error, the money was ours.  It made us so happy to finally own our own home.  It feels like we have made great progress in our life, and even though the money was unearned we are proud to be where we are now.  These past few weeks we have had such a great feeling, it's a goal of so many people and we are there.  I'm not sure why they did this for us, but the God's were smiling on us that day.  I'm sure my husband has never had such an unexpected gift as that before, and it feels as much mine as his.  I sometimes wonder if there is some unexpected down side to what just happened, I feel undeserving.  I hope there is nothing in our future to balance this out.

{"text":"Growing up with my family was quite hard. My parents were extremely religious and hated homosexuality. This made it extremely difficult living in their household because I am a lesbian. I always worried about what they would do if they found out. I still haven't told them because of how they act. They probably would never speak to me again. That's what they did to my grandfather, anyway.  Before he died, it was found out that he had a relationship with a fellow sailor while serving in the Navy. My family kept it very secret, and I only heard them talk about it in private once or twice. They were disgusted by him and were worried his actions would affect their standing in the church. They were so upset that they didn't talk to him for the last few months of his life. Last weekend my grandfather passed away. My mother didn't even show up to his funeral. I wonder how they could be so heartless, especially to their own family members. It makes me really sad that they've closed themselves off from the world so much.

{"text":"In the beginning of April my grandfather died. He had been ill with dementia and physically deteriorating for a while but I still wasn't prepared to lose him. He was mentally declining and most of the time he would just sit in his chair and go in and out of a mental fugue state. The last time I saw him was six days before he died. He was already in hospice care and depressed. I showed him a picture of my newborn son and we talked about baseball. It was his favorite sport and he loved to watch the Detroit Tigers. He was very lucid and aware. He talked to me about how much he still missed Verlander since the trade and that he hoped the Tigers would have a good year despite losing so many players. He then told me that my baby looked like my wife. It was a very emotional day. His death really taught me to appreciate every moment of every day. I had spent so much of my time rushing through life that I never bothered to consider that it will eventually end. There will be some people who will really miss me after I am gone. I inherited money from his estate and invested the bulk of it. One of my most fond, recurring, memories from when I was a child was going to my grandparents lake cottage and spending weekends and vacations there. To honor my grandfather and provide my own children that kind of experience I purchased a cottage this summer, on a lake about an hour and a half drive away. On weekends we all go up there and relax. My daughter loves the beach and just sitting out in the shady yard. My little one is scooting around the place pretty good and likes to go sit under an umbrella and play in the sand. Every time I am there I think about my grandfather and wish so very, very much that he could be there to enjoy this with us. At times it feels like he is there. I firmly intend to instill all the values that I learned from him over the years. He was a good man, a simple man, and he was always looking for the sun after the rain.","label":1}

We planned a road trip to go pick him up, and it was going to take us about 8 hours to get there. We were all super excited and began our trip on Friday morning. Dad didn't check the car for any problems as it's usually fine, but we all definitely regret not convincing him to. We were only 2 hours into the ride when the car started to smell a little a funky. We didn't think much of it since we just wanted to see our cute new puppy. Then after another hour the check engine light came on and that was a sign for the worst. Only 3 hours into the trip and the engine was billowing smoke all over the highway. Turns out the radiator blew and it wasn't going to be possible to keep driving. The owner of the puppy said we had to be there as it was a first come first serve deal and the puppy was definitely wanted by more people than us. Without a way to keep on going, Dad called up AAA and had them tow the car. They couldn't tow the car to where we were going and then back, so we had to cancel the trip and go home. Because of this we missed on the opportunity to get the puppy. Since then we've been very demotivated to try and find a new puppy.","label":0}
{"text":"A couple of months ago, my family and I hosted a game night. We usually don't do this. Not for any particular reason, but because we never really thought to do it. However, one day, I thought it would be a good idea. Everyone had been feeling a little bit down because of the death of our house cat, Bubbles. Nonetheless, we invited all of our family friends, along with some of my cousins, aunts, and uncles. We had planned to make it for Saturday, and the goal was just to make it a fun family\/friend gathering where we could all enjoy ourselves playing some games. And we sure did! Everyone came, and there was a total of 20 people at our house that night. My mom, dad, and sister were all pretty excited and so was I. We had chosen a lot of family board games to play along with some card games. At one point, everyone in the room could not stop laughing over the dumbest thing. It was slap happy hour apparently. It was probably the greatest game night everyone there had ever experienced, and I'm not exaggerating. It was a fun time with my family and friends. I love all of them so much, and this night will forever be a good memory.","label":0}

{"text":"Two months my husband and I decided to go on vacation. We had a difficult time choosing a country in Europe. We deliberated for months before this, before we finally decided that we should make the vacation more exciting. To this this, we decided to rule out Europe and choose a South American country or an Asian country. At the end, we decided to chose Japan. This is a complete surprise because I never had any intention of going to a country outside of Europe. After making our choice, we did some research, prepared and traveled to Japan. Arriving Japan felt like arriving at a different world or an alternate world. Everything just felt different and strange. I have been to two other countries outside the US, but they were countries that had quiet a similar culture to US so it was easy. Japan was a lovely country, the country felt so organised, maybe a bit too organised. I am someone who loves structure but I was overwhelmed by how structured everything was.  The Japanese people were very polite and friendly, we had bonus points for trying to learn how to speak their language. The Japanese people were neat almost to a fault. All the streets and public places were so clean that it felt like they all had germophobia. They were also incredibly disciplined, they always kept to their words. After three interesting weeks in Japan, my husband and I decided to come back to the US. We felt good coming back, but we couldn't stop ourselves from making a lot of comparisons.","label":1}
{"text":"Four months ago my nephew was involved in an accident. It was so  bad he almost lost his life. He was admitted in the hospital for ten days. I was so worried about him and visited him every day. I was really worried about my brother and his wife too because it has to be so hard to watch a child go through something like that. I am glad he was discharged and has now made a full recovery. I really worry that nothing ever happens like that again. Makes me think about my son and the kind of things I won't be able to protect him. The accident my nephew was involved in wasn't his fault and there was no way for him to prevent it. It just makes you think about how unpredictable life really is. There are so many things in life that you just can not control. Some times it is hard to find hope that my son will be able to be lucky enough to avoid such circumstances as my nephew. I think it does help to know that my nephew is fine because it gives me a little hope that things will be okay even if my son gets into some unexpected accident. I still check in on my nephew every week or so just so he knows I am thinking about him. I think this really showed him how much he is loved.","label":0}
{"text":"Roughly 3 weeks ago me and my girlfriend of a year broke up. It had been coming for a while, but i do not think it was something i was ready to fully accept. About 4 months ago, she got very sick. During this period where she was sick, she was completely bed ridden and i did not get to see her often. There was a lot of tension between us because of this. It started with us starting to say hateful stuff towards each other. I would tell her that i hated i never got too see her, and that I it felt like i was not even in a relationship. She told me that she's sorry i felt that way, but I needed to get over myself. This of course, hurt me very much. We had been friends for years before we even considered dating, and the relationship was starting to fade. I could not bring myself to end it at the time, so we continued. The situation worsened as time went on. We went from remarks, to full on hating each other. She would come over and i would tell her that i did not want to see her. I started having anxiety attacks thinking about what the relationship was coming too. When my birthday came around, I sat her down and told her that I was seriously not happy with the relationship, and it needed to end. She agreed and i have not talked to her since. This event has been very hard on me as, because this was someone i wanted to build a life with and within one night, it was all gone.","label":1}
{"text":"I thought that it would be a normal morning. But what I thought would be normal, turned into probably one of the worst days I have ever experienced. I woke up, and checked my phone, much as most people do. I had many missed calls and texts, which was odd. I looked at the messages, only to find that my beloved aunt had died. I was so upset. It was extremely tough to take in. When I went over to my mom, she had been crying all night. It was extremely difficult for her. Not only was I hurting, but now I also had to be tough in order to help my mom out. I was more than willing to complete the task though. I was ready to step up to the plate as the voice of reason. I love my mother so much. We had a funeral for my aunt with so much more crying. Now, we honor our aunt with a photo of her in our living room.","label":0}

{"text":"I hired a lawn service at the beginning of summer. I had a \"not so great\" feeling about him from the start. He's done an okay job, but he's never consistent with timing. He'll show up anywhere from a week to two weeks a part. No problem though. I can deal with that. He emails an invoice on the last day of every month, which is due within 20 days. I always just pay right away, so there's never been a complaint from his end. Well, he was here at the end of September, but October 13th came around and he still wasn't here. I hadn't paid for October yet simply because I forgot. I had a lot going on, but it's not like it was late. The payment wasn't even due until the 20th. The morning of the 13th, I get this angry email that there will be a late fee for payments made late. So, I immediately grab my invoice to make sure he didn't change the due date on it or something and I missed it. But, nope, it wasn't due till the 20th. So, I shoot him an email saying I had no intention of paying it late, but thanks for the warning, I guess. He ends up sending me four rude emails throughout the day saying that just because the bill says the 20th doesn't mean I have to wait till then to pay it. And, he said he doesn't like to babysit customers and all of kinds of other garbage. I was nice initially, thinking maybe he confused me with someone else. I mean, I've always paid like the day I get the bill. He definitely didn't have me confused. He just kept being rude until I finally sent him back a message telling him basically where he could shove his business and what I thought of him. It really stressed me out. I couldn't even sleep that whole night because he had me so worked up all day over this. I don't think I've ever had such bad customer service.","label":1}

I studied a lot for this test but thought about what would happen if I were to score low on the test. I was up almost all night before the test thinking about this and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t really sleep. I knew I was prepared but I heard the test was really hard. I decided to relax and be detached from the outcome. The morning finally came and the time was up. I picked up my bag and then started the test. It took me around 3 hours to complete it but the whole time I was nervous, some of the answers I knew but my mind suddenly forgot all about them. I tried to do my best and came out of the test wanting to know the results already. I was really nervous and fidgety. The results finally came and I made it, I was so happy because all my hard work had paid off. I even had a higher grade than expected and decided to celebrate with my friends and family. I had a great time with them and they all congratulated me because of my accomplishment. I guess being nervous in this situation was unavoidable. . I felt great and accomplished and now its time to think about new goals.","label":1}
{"text":"An important event that really started to make me have memories would be crossing the road with my new puppy. You see, not too long ago we bought a puppy and he was very nice. However, the only thing he was scared of was the fact that there are things that look like cars. He doesn't know what they are, keep in mind he is still very young. But at the end of the day we pushed him to his limits so that he can overcome these things. After a while, the dog learned to not chase cars nor bite on their wheels. As a result, this meant that our dog is one dog that is not scared of anything in this life making him immune to the most compelling emotions of fear. As a result, this made me love the dog much more because that meant something. The more I think about it, the more my heart is filled with joy throughout the decades. I have never imagined that I would have a dog. And nevermind actually have a dog that lets me motivate him to do things that I never thought he could do. I guess that is another part of life that we must account for. Everything that is alive is capable of learning even rocks can do that too. For example rocks have the capacity to morph due to heat and temperature. To us it would be a different thing however at the end of the day it is exactly the same stressors that make up who we are.","label":1}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, I was fortunate to be attending my 20 year old son's \"White Coat\" Ceremony for his acceptance to Pharmacy School. His older brother has already been in Pharmacy school for the past two years and his younger brother was wanting to join him. For me as a parent, I was super excited and happy for my son. He has had some challenges getting to this point, some were academic and some were personal. His mom did not have the confidence that he would get in, and I did not waiver in my belief that he would make it in. Samuel (20 year old) is a very hard worker, but at times can be lazy. He initially started his college career at the main University and was struggling. I convinced him to start his schooling at the local community college to help with the transition. He objected at first, he thought it would look like he failed, but it turned out to be the best decision that he made. He met a professor there that inspired his passion for the Pharmacy school. I really think his path via community college helped shape his direction into getting accepted to Pharmacy school. His older brother (Albert) also played a huge role in helping and support. I was very emotional knowing that the two brothers were working together and that Albert was excited to see Samuel with him at school. I was a proud parent that day, and as a family we felt very fortunate,  the best thing to come out of the experience was the example to my youngest son (Jacob) who is eleven. He wants to pursue a career in the medical field as well.","label":1}
{"text":"It was my cousins wedding that was very memorable. She just got married a week ago. It was a great wedding they rented out a building that was big and beautiful. It was like a big log cabin but not exactly. They had good music and great food. It was fun socializing with everyone. Until the actual wedding started they thanked everyone for being there and had great speeches. When they finally said their vows and did the ring and everything it was perfect and beautiful. The after party was especially memorable for me we had so much fun. We drank a lot and danced so much it was great. Overall just a great wedding really enjoyed it. I will be remembering it for a long time. I suppose the best thing was how sweet they were to each other. They were so cute and made for each other. I wish my wedding had been half as amazing. I hope to do something this fun again.","label":1}
{"text":"My relationship with my father has not been good for years.  Growing up, he was cold and distant, much more interested in his work and his life than he was in mine or the rest of his family.  As the years went on, I did not include him in much of our lives.  I felt resentment and that he would be the same type of grandfather that he was as a father.  I did not want my children to have this negative experience in their lives.  We did see him some as I felt I should include him in the big events in our lives as he was my father.  Last Spring, he came to visit.  I was actually happy he was visiting.  There were good times with him growing up and I missed those and that side of him.  I did love that side of him but I always felt conflicted.  My 3 boys were older now and I was less concerned about his effect on them as they had their own lives in school and with friends now.  My oldest son expressed an interest  in visiting his grandfather.   While I was hesitant at first, they had plans on things they wanted to do together and it was only for one day and back the next morning.  The visit went very well and my son told me Grandpa wanted to play the guitar like I did when he visited us.  This was quite a change for dad from his younger years.   My son's visit was 4 months ago and I have seen dad since.  I have come to realize he has changed for the better with the years.  He now is interested in spending time with his family.  I never doubted that my father loved me but I see he also loves my boys.  We have included dad more in our lives in the last 4 months and it has gone well.  I am happy our relationship has taken this turn and I get to have the father I wished he would have been when I was younger and my boys have grandpa.  We will continue to see more of each other.  This is a very pleasant surprize this year!","label":0}

I had worked for him for over 20 years so my history with him was long and complicated.

I felt like I had no choice in leaving though. My other boss was deteriorating mentally and physically and would not admit to his deficiencies. He would not be able to concentrate and was shirking his work. I could not stand by and let him ignore his work. We managed other people's money. Their accounts were being ignored and there was nothing I could do about it. After being notified about the funeral, my old boss and I had a chance to chat and it was really nice.

However, my husband had to call medical services to get help since it wasn't something we could handle. Now I'm doing better, thankfully. At least it makes for a story for our family. Now I'm going to make sure to keep myself monitored closely so it doesn't happen again.","label":0}

{"text":"I can now say I am writing this from my new apartment in downtown Denver! I was stuck in the midwest for most of my life. Growing up in Ames, Iowa, there wasnt a lot of career paths for me. I went to college locally and got an engineering degree, but was expected to go into agriculture. My whole family is farmers and manual work, so getting a fancy degree always had some sneers and jeers. I started working, predictably, at a farming co-op designing feed bags, but wasnt something I was really passionate about. Then about 4 months ago I got an offer from a company I applied with quite some time before. They wanted to call me and do a phone interview and I quickly agreed. They were looking for someone to test concrete density and wear and tear at the higher altitudes to see if they could make better roads up in the mountains. They were impressed with the initial call and offered to fly me out in person. I wasn't going to say no to a free vacation so i got on a plane and went to the meeting. The project lead was so impressed with the interview that he tentatively offered me a job on the spot. I still had to clear HR, but that went over smoothly. A few weeks later I got a relocation bonus check contingent on me starting and staying with the company for a year. I packed up most of my things in a Uhual and drove out to Colorado. Its beautiful here and I couldnt be happier with the way the job has turned out. I am living the dream I always had to get out of the corn fields of Iowa!","label":0}

{"text":"One week ago I was sitting at my desk at work when a woman walked by that I had never seen before. Immediately she caught my attention since I was very attracted to her, but I simply went back to my work once a moment or two had passed. I was writing an email to a coworker when she walked by again. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see that she was heading toward the break room. I decided that the email could wait so I decided to mosey on over to the break room myself to get a cup of coffee, and if she so happened to be in there then that would be just great. I walk in and notice her standing at the coffee machine pouring herself a cup. I walk up and wait for her to be done when she goes to get a packet of sugar to add to her coffee when she notices the container is empty. She doesn't seem to know where the extras are stored so I open up and tell her that the spare sugar packets are stored in the cabinet above the sink. She thanks me and walks over to the previously mentioned cabinet. She thanks me and introduces herself as Pam, and I nod my head and tell her my name is Tim. As I pour myself a cup of coffee, I remark that I haven't seen her around the office before and ask if she just started working here. She responds that she is actually just here for the week as she is running a training seminar for people in the accounting department. I feel slightly relieved by this since that means if something does happen between us it won't be an awkward office romance, but at the same time I was a bit upset because she was only here for a week. I grab myself a cookie and offer her one to go with the coffee she is drinking. She accepts. Seeing as how it's Thursday and she will be done with her training seminar tomorrow, I decide to go for broke and do something I normally never do. I just straight up ask her if she would like to grab some dinner sometime with me. She smiles and gives me her phone number and tells me to text her later so we can work something out. I add her number and smile and tell her I should probably get back to work, but if she needs any more help finding other condiments to come find me at my desk and I'll be happy to help. She laughs and says she will be looking for my text. I go back to my desk and resume writing the email, but this time in a much better mood.","label":0}

We got in the car and I started driving. Van Buren to the 60 to the 210 to the 5. The kids had no idea where we were going until I was getting off the freeway at Magic Mountain Pkwy. Theire eyes lit up as we pulled into the nearly empty parking lot. We had so much fun! We rode X2 and Viper and Batman The Ride. We ate some burgers for lunch in the park and continued riding as much as we could. We stayed until the park closed just after dark and rode a couple of the rides in the dark. Before we left, we made sure to get some funnel cake in one of the shops by the main gate. On the way home, it was burgers from Wendy's and a long, exhausting drive.

{"text":"It was only the middle of August however I was already thrilled about sisters birthday being only one in half months away, and I couldn't wait until we got our presents for her out and the beautiful birthday cake my mother makes every year. I loved to wake her up early in the morning and sing her Happy Birthday before the sun had even started to peek over the horizon. \t  Being only August though the countdown for her birthday had not yet begun so my mom decided to try and beat it and get my sisters birthday shopping done early. So one Saturday morning my mom and I went to the mall to shop for my sister. We were at a store shopping for my sister when I saw a bright yellow advertising sign hanging from the ceiling which was an advertisement for Payless, that just happened to be on the opposite end of the mall from where we were. On the sign, there were the coolest slippers I had ever seen. They were massaging slippers in the shape of animals particularly the one on the sign was a pink unicorn. The slippers themselves were pink which made them even greater because that is her favorite color. As soon as I saw these breathtaking slippers I tugged on my mothers' sleeve and pointed at the sign. Without the slightest bit of interest she just merely glanced up at the sign and went back to what she was looking at, so I had kept my eye on that sign for the entire time we were in the store, not acknowledging a word my mom said to me the rest of the time. After my mother had finished and rung her gifts out I tugged on her arm to get her attention and said I had to go across the mall that I would meet her at the car. I hadn't told her what store I was going to or for what but she walked out the exit doors of the mall and I continued on my way to Payless. When I got there I looked around the store feverishly and still couldn't find the slippers I was looking for so I stopped an employee and asked her where they were. She pointed me in the direction of the far back of the store so I took off for that corner and when I got there I saw a pile of boxes with unicorn heads sticking out of them. So then I looked through the boxes for her size and when I found them I brought them up and paid for them and ran to the mall exit hoping I hadn't detained my mother in the car for too long. When I got there she had asked me what was in the bag and I showed her, she smirked and burst out laughing and offended I asked her what was so funny because I knew my sister would love them. She smiled and explained that my other sister had bought her a massaging neck warmer that was in the shape of a unicorn and was pink and she said that only sisters could pick out a perfect pair without even knowing what the other had  gotten.","label":1}

{"text":"I finished landscaping my courtyard about two months ago. I bought my condo last year and the courtyard was one thing I had always wanted and had based my purchase on it. I've taken horticulture in college so I'm pretty knowledgeable about how to do it. About 4 years before I purchased the condo, previous owners had hired a landscape company to decorate it with a flowering tree, plants, pond and black river rock stone as mulch. They sold the condo to a retired woman a year later and she never even pulled one weed. So when I bought it, it was an overgrown jungle. My first step was pulling out weeds and dead bushes. My next step, which took about 3 months, was pulling out all the river rock from about 1 foot down in the dirt. From rain and other weather, the rocks had sunken down through the landscape fabric and underneath all the weeds. Every day, I spent 15-30 minutes overturning the dirt, one shovel scoop at a time, then pulling each rock out (from 1 in. to 4 inches wide) and tossing them into huge plastic bins in the garage. I then drew out a new landscape plan, bought the plants, dug the holes and planted them. To my surprise, I called a pond company and I was able to afford their services of rebuilding my broken down pond and adding a filter, pump and some underwater plants. After that was all done, I called a landscape company to drag the bins out of the garage, lay down new landscape fabric and all those black rocks. I also brought out my garden decor, added fish to the pond, added some smaller plants to decorative pots and finally stood back to look at my work. I can't believe how beautiful it is and my neighbors also love it. It's a soothing place to come out to several times a day for relaxation.","label":1}

{"text":"I was part of a rather remarkable occurrence that took place over the past 3 months. I fear that if I don't write it down soon I may not believe it myself in another 1\/4 of a year. As you might know, there are no leash laws in my community. The neighborhood dogs tend to spend the days visiting each other and ... being dogs. Most of them go back to the particular human family that \"owns them\" at night to be fed and cared for, but there are always a few that don't seem to belong to anyone in particular and just sort of make the rounds between a few different homes. Well, my wife stumbled on a post on facebook that a local stray who we had always called Rufus had been taken into the pound by animal control. He had been found under a nearby house when the homeowners investigated the source of a whimpering noise they had been hearing for a few days. Apparently there was a thorn in his foot that had become badly infected, and these people (not having money for veterinary care, nor desiring to have a dog) had him taken to the shelter. Well, I had always been rather fond of Rufus in passing. So when my wife suggested we cover the cost of his antibiotics and adopt him I agreed. A couple weeks of healing and good food and he was back to his rascally good nature. However, now that we \"owned\" him on paper problems began to arise. You see, my wife and I live on the edge of town and coyotes live in the valley below us. They don't really cause any trouble in town, but they are the reason that most farmers in the area have a dog to scare them away from livestock. It used to be that when the coyotes would start \"singing\" at night several of the town dogs would \"rap battle\" right back. A territory thing I suppose ... Well, Rufus in particular had always seemed to see it as part of his oikos to protect the smaller dogs and bark loudly to keep the coyotes at bay. Nobody ever seemed to mind, but once he became \"our\" dog that changed. Neighbors began to call the police with noise complaints. They demanded that we keep him in the house at night. Now, he was a very sweet dog, obedient to many commands like sit, shake, Eskimo Kiss, etc. but being rather a free spirit the one thing he would not do is come when he was called. He would come close enough to \"check in\" but not quite into arms reach until he was good and ready. Well, after a few more exchanges with the cops we started keeping him tied up with a cable when he went out so we could make sure that he came inside at night. Well, one night the local pack of coyotes were raising a right ruckus. Long story short, Rufus broke the cable and ran off to join them, I have been hearing his deep happy bark mingling with their song from the valley.","label":0}

{"text":"I think that euthanasia should be legal but strictly regulated. I don't believe that it is morally right to preserve someone's life if they are terminally ill, suffering a great deal, and express the wish to die. I can understand why the idea makes people uneasy, but both a rational consideration of the matter and a genuinely empathetic moral appraisal suggest that assisted suicide is a valuable thing to have as an option. So I believe that euthanasia should not be as strictly illegal as it currently is in most states.","label":1}

I was ordered a job at her office and I was to deliver the job to her. To be candid, I was not in the right emotional state to easily comprehend her simple order of bringing the files to her office. So, I just sat there waiting for her to come outside and sign the papers. Soon, I slept off. After some few hours, I was already dreaming of how possible I could solve my other problem that put me off in the first instance. Then, I felt a light tap on my left shoulder. I opened my eyes and it was already dark. Wow! I exclaimed. \"You must be very tired\", she said. \"Would you love some Chinese\". I was surprised at the kind gesture, but had to follow through by asking her to sign the paper first. She is just nice, I thought to myself while I was in bed later that night. Right now, she is my wife!","label":1}

{"text":"This summer we went on a two month van camping trip across many states of the USA. We visited a lot of new places but the most memorable was visiting Laura Ingalls Wilder's childhood home. This was on a working farm. There were animals, including an adorable baby miniature horse. I was able to ride a covered wagon. I also visited a schoolhouse like the one she would have attended and taught in. A volunteer provided a lesson and challenged us with things children back then would have been required to know. We walked our dogs across fields and up to the edge of the crops. We could also see an old church in the distance across the field. There was a museum with a movie to watch as well. The best part was probably the reproductions of the sod house, the claim shack, and their first home on the prairie. Re-enactors demonstrated the ways of life in times past. We were able to camp right there on the farm. While camping, a neighbor family in a nearby camper had a birthday party for their little girl. They invited us to come over for ice cream cake. While we were all singing Happy Birthday around the picnic table, a lot of cows came right up to the fence to see what was going on. That was so funny.","label":1}
{"text":"I recently suffered a broken leg. I was working on a ladder painting my house. After a long afternoon of painting, I was feeling a bit tired and began to descend the ladder. I missed a rung on the ladder and fell about 9 feet. When I hit the ground, I felt incredible pain in my left leg. After standing up and trying to walk, I couldn't put any pressure on my leg and the pain was almost overwhelming. Luckily, my wife was home at the time and drove me to the hospital. After waiting for over an hour, I was finally seen by a doctor in the emergency room.  The doctor began the examination by moving my leg and I nearly screamed from the pain. He gave my a shot filled with pain medication of some kind and sent me for a x-ray. The x-ray determined that my leg had fractured just below the knee.  Luckily, it was a clean break. I was given a flexible cast, a prescription for antibiotics and pain pills, and sent home. It has now been about a month since the accident. I am no longer in pain. The flex cast can come off in about two weeks. I am grateful to have recovered and I will take ladders more seriously the next time I paint my house!","label":1}

{"text":"April 25 2019.  This has been one of the hardest days of my life.   I lost my little friend, Prance.   I should start by saying that Prance was a rescue dog.  Prance came from a local shelter.  Prance was 3 years old when I got him.   The day, April 17,  that I got Prance was exactly a year to the day that I had lost another dog, Butch.   Like Butch, Prance was a Schnauzer.   I woke up that morning and just had a strong desire to go to the animal shelter. And there was Prance.     From the first moment, we bonded, and he was like my little grey shadow. April 17th 2019, I treated  the day like it was Prance's birthday, since he actual birth date was unknown.    He had turned 12.   Prance had always been a very picky eater and he had started refusing his food.   On the 4th day of not eating, I took Prance to the vet.   Prance had pancreatitis and had to be hospitalized.   When Prance came home, he was refusing to eat again.    Prance began to get very weak and had difficulty standing up.     He was now at a point where he could not walk at all.   Prance was laying next to me, as he always was, while I watched TV.    Prance suddenly reached out his paw to me 3 times, like he would do when he wanted to get some attention.   I picked Prance up and held him.   Prance began to tremble and shake.   He took a couple of deep breathes and went limp in my arms.      I  feel like Prance reached out to me to say goodbye, and e I am happy that I was there  for him in his last moment of life.","label":1}
{"text":"When people think of the scariest day of their life they often think of a near death experience or the loss of a loved one.   For me, it was when my wife started having complications while giving birth.  It all happened about 5 months ago when we were about to welcome the birth of our son.  It started off like we expected: my wife went into labor, we waited until the contractions were getting closer and then we headed for the hospital.  I thought everything seemed like it was going as planned but as I quickly learned, complications can happen suddenly.  As we were walking into the hospital my wife suddenly loss consciousness and I happened to catch her just as she was about to fall to the floor.  As the nurses rushed to her aid I was in shock of what was happening.  This couldn't possibly be normal.  Everything seemed to be in slow motion.  She was put on a stretcher, rushed to a room and I followed behind helplessly and numb from what was happening.  After the doctor arrived and several checks were done he explained that my wife was having some sort of complications, her airflow was being restricted and they needed to do emergency surgery to deliver our baby.  After everything was prepared I was allowed to stay by her side and watch as the doctor started the c-section to deliver our baby.  As he was doing the procedure he noticed what the issue was.  According to him, scar tissue from a previous surgery had attached itself to the underside of one side of her lung and the combination of that and the baby putting pressure on her organs had caused her to lose consciousness.  He said he'd never seen something like that happen but was expecting the pressure to be relieved once his procedure was finished.  Several minutes later I was able to hold our baby for the first time and shortly after that my wife woke from the procedure.  Needless to say I counted my blessings that day and our lives have never been the same.","label":0}

We'd never had an argument even before this. He was just shouting. I was very scared, and I didn't know what to do. It made me feel angry, scared, and anxious. He didn't get physical, but it felt like he might. After a while, he did calm down. Still, I asked him and demanded him to leave. It was very obvious that he had a drinking problem, since this was the first time I've seen him drunk. Shortly after, I broke off the relationship. I just could not believe it.","label":0}
{"text":"It was one week ago that our world changed forever. My step father, a very healthy man most of his life, was suddenly struck ill with a possible stroke. As a family, we've always been close. We generally know when one or another is sick or feeling bad. He had exhibited signs and symptoms, but we could not get him to respond or go to the Doctor. It really upset us that we could not get him to go. His stubbornness initially made us mad, but we got past that. He was just too ill to feel mad at during this dire situation. Upon visiting the doctor at the ER, he was diagnosed with a Subdural Hematoma. A Subdural Hematoma is what doctors refer to as a traumatic brain injury - which is in effect a collection of blood between the covering of the brain. It is very serious and can lead to death or disabilities if left untreated.  The Doctor will usually put you on a blood thinning medication such as Warfarin if your body is able to respond. Fortunately for our family, he got there in the nick of time. He is resting, recuperating, and responding to treatment and prognosis is looking great for a full recovery. We now wonder if his initial stubbornness was the result of the stroke - that is, the symptoms of not fully understanding the seriousness of the matter and deciding against going to the hospital.","label":0}

I've missed him so I wanted to take a quick weekend trip just to hang out. I ended up staying at his place on the beach which was amazing. Each morning we had breakfast at the local diner and then we would head to the beach to relax a bit. It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up. The most memorable part was the walk we took after supper along the shoreline. The tide was starting to come ashore and he stopped and gave me a gentle kiss. I was stunned when he pulled out a small box with a necklace inside. I was blown away by his kindness. I can't wait until we see each other again but I know it will be a few months.  I just hope we can both wait this distance out and one day be together.

I asked her if she wanted some avocado. She usually loves to eat avocado. I expected a simple nod yes. Instead she goes, \"no thank you.\" She has said yes and no and thank you separately already. However, she has yet to put it all together. We have prompted her a lot, guiding her to this. She finally understood and verbalized! I called Aaron over in hopes she would say it again and he could hear. It's important for us as parents that she is able to verbally exercise consent and has an understanding of it from a young age. Raising a girl and being a woman myself, I am very aware of the risks she faces growing up in a society that views women as objects and does not necessarily respect us when we say no. I figure the earlier she learns her voice and that she has choices in things, the more likely she is to speak up for herself in a variety of ways. I know this may turn into her telling me, \"no\" to things a lot, but I welcome the conflict. I'm excited to see how she continues to develop!","label":0}

One day he was healthy and strong, and the next he was reduced to a thin frail man who could barely walk. As the disease progressed it became more and more obvious he would be leaving us soon. That reality was so hard to accept. I remember crying for days nonstop thinking about life without him. He didn't deserve this. No one deserves cancer, but he was such a good person he really didn't deserve anything like this. The day he died was like any other day. We were sitting around his bed talking and joking. Something was playing on the television in the background. I remember looking at him and thinking he looked peaceful. I looked back again and his eyes were closed. And that was it.

{"text":"Hi Diary, As you know I have suffered with depression for four to five years and I've had anxiety attacks for much longer. Medication from the doctors that have not helped. They gave me pregablin, which is essentially speed, which helps with the depression and also the sciatica I suffer with, but I hate taking it. A few months back I was watching some documentary about LSD and how it could help depression. So I decided to speak to a friend who gets LSD. I'd never tried it before, but have taken many other substances over the years. I decided to try micro dosing for a month. I was taking an eighth of a tab every five days. My depression lifted almost entirely after the third dose. My productivity increased ten fold. I found sitting on the sofa horrible, something I'd done almost non stop for four years. My perspective changed, I was way happier and my wife, who has never taken any substances, noticed the difference immediately and my new mood made her much happier. The clarity of thought whilst dosed and the following days is something I'd never experienced. I was absolutely amazed at how well it worked. I haven't dosed for 10 days and I feel awful. Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, not sleeping and I'm back on the sofa. I have some of my last tab left, so I think I will start dosing again.","label":1}

{"text":"Everyone keeps telling me that I don't spend enough time with people. My brother especially keeps saying that I should do stuff with our parents more often since they're starting to get on a bit;- i.e. I don't necessarily know how long I have left with them and will regret it later. So to that end, I organised a little bowling trip. There's a place that does bowling only about a 30min bus ride away and it's something they've done before (without me; as mentioned i am a miserly twit) so I knew they'd be interested. And as an added bonus, there's a bar on-site, so I can drink enough to forget how much I inevitably lose by.","label":0}

{"text":"Just last month, I went on a trip to Lassen National Park with my older brother to celebrate my birthday. It wasn't actually my birthday yet, but I love hiking and my brother lives in another part of the state and couldn't go on my actual birthday so we decided to go on our annual hiking trip and chose Lassen for our destination. A friend of a friend had recently visited and showed pictures of the snow-covered mountain, and we both thought it would be fun to go to somewhere with snow in the middle of summer. I took a bus to Oakland and then we drove from there to Lassen, arriving at the park and snagging a camping spot at 3 AM but sleeping in the car. We woke up around 6 AM with the sun filtering between the pines, and set up our tents and  made breakfast. We went to the ranger station to ask for advice and recommendations. We then went around the Manzanita Lake, and saw gorgeous views of snow-covered Lassen Peak reflected across the placid lake with ducks and ducklings bobbing in and out of the water. We rented a kayak and paddled around the lake, admiring the views and relaxing under the sun and cool, light breeze. We were still pretty tired from the long trip, so we just relaxed in our campsite for the rest of the day, cooking and reading and chatting. The next day we headed up to Butte Lake to hike the Cinder Cone Volcano. It looked like a short and easy hike until we started going up the volcano since the steep trail consisted of loose cinders that made you slip back some inches with every step forward. It was the first time I'd ever gone up to a volcano's crater, and the views were fantastic. Going down was more of psychological challenge since I felt like I would slide down to my death and went down very slowly. We relaxed by the Butte Lake and dipped our dirty, dusty feet on the freezing water until heading over to Redding to buy some microspikes since we wanted to climb up Lassen Peak. Redding was hot and uneventful, but we got our microspikes. We had to wake up early the next day to climb the Lassen Peak, and although we were expecting snow, we didn't realize how much snow there actually still was. As SoCal residents we usually just see snow in the distant San Gabriel mountains, and driving up close to 15 feet high snowbanks was a surreal and awesome experience. We'd never hiked in snow and were really excited to try out the microspikes, but I was also hesitant since I'm prone to altitude sickness and was hoping it wouldn't ruin our trip. Luckily I didn't and we powered our way up the snowy trail, removing the spikes once the snow had melted away near the top. The views, as ever, were gorgeous and we looked down on a snow-dappled landscape and an icy lake. We reached the summit and took many photos, watching some people ski down the side of the mountain. It was an awesome trip and one of my most memorable ones.","label":1}
{"text":"In June I had to have my dog put to sleep. Her name was Ginger. She was twelve and a half years old. This was a decision I had been dreading for weeks. For a basset hound, Ginger was usually rather spry. Around March of this year she began to spend most of her either in her bed or curled up next to me on the couch. I attributed her behavior to old age, and the vet agreed. He could find no illness or injury. Over the coming weeks she became progressively weaker until she was unable to walk. Her breathing was increasingly labored. I delayed the decision for as long as I could. On June 22, I carried her, bed and all, to the car and drove her to the vet.  He agreed that she would not recover and felt that ending her suffering was the correct decision. Throughout, Ginger was as alert and affectionate as ever. This made everything more difficult for me. I was certain that I was doing the right thing, but sometimes the right thing really sucks. Ginger was a playful, smart, and affectionate dog. She was a wonderful companion and definitely a member of the family. I will miss her greatly for a long time.","label":1}

Dropped everyone off. Then went and parked. Met up with everyone and went inside. Spent a fun filled 3 hrs there.  My nieces had a great time. Really got to enjoy everything the place had to offer. There was no rushing, everyone waited for everyone to get their fill before moving on. I had an amazing time. I love fish and over sized aquariums. I have been a half a dozen times. Most of my enjoyment came from watching them experience it for the first time. Well worth the time and money.","label":1}
{"text":"My recent event that was memorable was traveling to Las Vegas.  My wife and I had traveled for the first time together.  I have been to Las Vegas twice before but she had never been.  She was in awe at how different things were compared to where we are from (Hawaii).  We had a great time seeing all the lights and people and going to the attractions.  I am very pleased at our experience there.  We will definitely need to go back another time.  Possibly do a road trip the next time we visit the states as we are from and isolated island in the Pacific.  My wife and I need to travel more often but it is very expensive to live in our state and can only make what it takes to survive out here.  I would like to be able to travel much more often than we currently do.  Hopefully next year we can either travel back to the states or to another country.  That is what is on my bucket list, to visit another country.  One thing,  I need to get a passport first.  I hear that it can be difficult to get if you dont know what to bring.  I will need to research to be fully prepared for the situation.","label":1}

{"text":"I recently attended a family gathering in Michigan and got to spend time with many family members.  it was in Michigan, in the northern part of the state.  I drove through Canada and stayed in Niagara Falls on the way.  Niagara Falls was beautiful.  I visited Bird Kingdom and ate poutine.  It took a long time to go through customs though.  In Michigan I went to a winery with my girlfriend, aunt, uncle, mom, and sister and we talked about growing up and got nostalgic.  The next day was my cousin's wedding.  I remember him as a baby so it was strange to see him getting married.  He is all grown up now.  Everyone laughed and drank and had fun.  I got to talk to all my aunts and uncles.  One uncle I had not seen in 10 years so it was nice to catch up.  He has been going through a rough patch.  Seeing everyone made me remember how much I loved them all.  I wished we lived closer.  It was a very memorable event.  I hope there is another wedding or family reunion soon.","label":1}
{"text":"I am very unhappy right now. I have just come home from court, yet again. My daughter, Beth, has just be involved in another crime with this 'gang' she has been hanging out with the last few years. My wife is so depressed about she can't even be involved with it anymore. This all started when Beth started hanging out with the wrong crowd around the time she turned 16. We first felt she was just going through a 'rebellious stage'. We were patient at first and tried to be supportive. The first time we found drugs (marijuana), we were calm with her but told her we never wanted to see these kinds of things in the house again. When we saw her bring boys over, we were firm but caring about the situation. It only got worst. She started hanging out during all her free time with a certain crowd of people, some of them much older than her. Her grades began to slip and we got bad reports from her teachers. It wasn't too much of surprise when we received a call from Target security that they had caught our daughter shoplifting. We had to pay a big fine but they left her off without any charges. We were livid with her on the way home. Perhaps if were more understanding...Things improved (seemingly) for Beth following this incident. Her grades improved and she even made honor roll. We had high expectations that she would still be able to get into a good college after graduation. It's sad to remember that when she was younger she was always the brightest student in her class. After this latest incident everything is finished though. She was caught by the police dealing drugs at park. Apparently it was heroin. There is nothing we can do for her now. From what the police tell us, Beth has been leading a secret life as an inspiring drug kingpin the last year. They told us that she was in contact with certain groups in Mexico to supply her with more heroin so can increase her business in the coming year. We have no choice but to kick her out at this point.","label":0}
{"text":"About three of four weeks ago I was waiting for refills on three of my medications. In order to save money, I have them sent from my insurance by mail order. I had just run out of the medication for my fibromyalgia when I checked my mail and found something from the pharmacy. But there was only one medication, the one for heartburn. I thought the other two may have been sent separately. I was worried because you're not suppose to stop taking this medication and even missing a single dose can make you a little sick. The first day I started getting increased pain, especially in my knees. I also started having problems thinking and concentrating. By Sunday I started feeling very weak, dizzy and like I had a bad stomach virus. I ended up really sick. I couldn't eat much and that also made my blood sugar issues worse. The pain got so intense that it felt as though all my bones were being twisted. It was like being in a nightmare. They had agreed to reconsider the medication and said it would take about 10 days. But as things kept getting worse so quickly, I wasn't sure I'd last that long. I live alone, so I kept my door unlocked in case I needed emergency help and couldn't open it myself, or to make it easier to find my body if I died. I didn't bathe for a few days because I worried I'd be too weak to climb out of the bathtub and possibly slip and die slowly from a head injury. They finally agreed to cover the medication and sent it express. I am still recovering from this. The worst of the pain is gone, but the knees still hurt. Since I also struggled with depression all my life and this medication also helps there, I've been really struggling with more depression. I'm still having trouble thinking and concentrating and my greatest worry is that my brain might not come all the way back. I'm suppose to see my doctor today to check on the progress. Hopefully he can ease my mind.","label":1}
{"text":"Five months ago I had to go to a deposition. It was in the next town and I do not own a car so I had to take a very early bus. There was a bad ice storm that day and it took a lot longer than I expected to get there.  Since I was running late I did not have time to get anything to eat before the deposition. During the deposition I was asked a lot of questions about my memory of the events (which I do not want to get into too much detail) and they continually made me feel like a liar and incompetant. They kept on implying that I was a bad person and it was a big pain in the ass. Afterwords I had to catch another bus back and only had time to get a hot dog from a street vendor. It must have been a bad one because on the ride back I was throwing up the whole way.  Luckily a kind person in the next seat helped me and gave me water and some baby wipes to clean up with.  It was a horrible experience overall but could have been even worse without the kindness of that man. I have developed a hatred for busses.  I no longer feel so great about hot dogs either. MY advice to others would be to not trust street food, especially if you are already stressed out. The stomach can do nasty things to you if it is not treated well. Hopefully I will never go through that again.","label":0}

{"text":"About 2 weeks ago, i went to Austin, Texas. I tried the food there when i was there and i was blown away. The barbeque there was top notch and all the meat was so tender. We also tried a sushi place nearby that was highly rated as well. I got some ramen as well as chicken karage while my friends got sushi. At night, we went to many different bars. There was a street full of bars with different themes. We went to one that had the theme of shipping containers. It was packed and we all had a great time. I've never been to Austin so going there for the first time really made me appreciate it. There were many food trucks and we tried many of them. I got to eat at a food truck that sold Peruvian food. My time in Austin will always be remembered. I hope to visit it again sometime in the future. I want to be able to discover other things there.","label":0}
{"text":"Three months ago, things took a turn for the better with my family. My husband had been applying to many different jobs. The one he had was not really cutting it for our finances, and money was really tight. We found that we were spending more money each month than we were earning. It was a very stressful time for us. My husband found a great job that paid almost three times his previous salary. He also got a signing bonus that allowed us to put down a down payment for a larger vehicle. We had to take two cars to get our whole family somewhere, and now we can all fit in our (new to us) van! We bought a 2012 Honda Odyssey and the color is a gorgeous deep red. We got a really good deal on it, and while I never really wanted a minivan, I'm glad that everyone can finally fit in one car. I was surprised how much I loved it! We were also able to catch up on our electricity and gas bills. We weren't behind a whole bunch but it was refreshing to finally be able to reach a balance of zero! It is so refreshing to be able to pay the bills. We have some money saved up now to get the kids some great gifts for Christmas. We won't be taking our newly found financial freedom for granted. I plan on being frugal with my household purchases and contributing to a large emergency fund.","label":0}

{"text":"From a young age I would always make friends with everyone. I believed that just because you looked different from me and or liked different things than me didn't mean that we couldn't find a way to connect on a common ground. With all that being said, I remember even finding a way to communicate with kids who were in ESOL. I would talk to the ones who knew some English to kids who didn't know English at all. I felt as though just because there is a language barrier doesn't mean that you can't find a way to communicate with them. Forwarding to January of this year, I was working in retail and I just felt like I wasn't fulfilling my life purpose. I also felt like wanted to get more out of life especially when it comes to helping people. I decided to enroll into a course to get my TEFL certification because there are many kids and adults who really want to learn English and I wanted to be the one to help them accomplish that. When I started my course I realized how much harder it was especially since I was juggling work, coursework, papers I had to write, demonstrations I had to perform, as well as tests\/assessments. I also realized how gratifying it would be when I did finish schooling. A month ago I found out that not only did I pass my final exam but I also passed my course with honors. As soon as I received my certification I immediately started applying to TEFL jobs. I heard back from about five jobs but decided to move forward with one of them. I don't know very many people who can honestly say that they love their job or their career and I am grateful enough to be able to say that I do. The decision I made to get my TEFL certification has been the absolute best decision of my life.","label":1}
{"text":"I adopted Chloe when she was just a little puppy. She was a pit bull, and no one at the shelter wanted to adopt her. They were afraid she would grow up and be dangerous. The moment I heard this, I knew I had to bring her home with me. We bonded immediately. It was so great watching her grow up. I loved teaching her things and she learned very quickly. She was very protective of me, but was never aggressive unless provoked. As the years went by, her muzzle started to gray. Her joints started to ache and she couldn't play the way she used to. She tried, though. She started sleeping more. She started having accidents in the house. One day I woke up to find that Chloe had passed in her sleep.

But, that's how life was for my family. I don't harbor any resentment. These things happen and not every family is perfect. Four months ago my older brother passed away. I didn't really feel too bad, not because I didn't love him (because I did), but we just hadn't talked much recently. Times like these are when I could experience regret.

{"text":"I received a notice from the town that i had to run a pipe directly to a sewer rather than into the street. I had to do it . After fighting with the town about they said I would be have to do it so I prepared all materials and got a friend to help me dig. It was a big project and was about 125 feet of area. I bought the pipes at  special store. I needed 10 foot hard plastic pipes about 3.5 inch diameter. Needed a friend with a van to get them.  Then We proceeded to dig down about two feet down thru all kinds of junk rocks roots etc. First part was from a central point that water went into and then the difficult part came  I had to go under a sidewalk. Thought this would be easy but was impossible till my 82 year old neighbor came over with two massive crowbar pipes and the three of us actually took out that piece of sidewalk  It was very hard and heavy. Then the last 70 feet was a straight run. The town had made a connection point for me so all I needed was to connect the two after much digging . The connection needed a special joint so it was off to the store. All the while had to put up tape and stakes to prevent people from going there It looked horrible. Now all connections were made and needed to concrete over the connection in the starting point which again my neighbor helped. He was great and knew how to do everything including pitch which was important so then we made some adjustments and finally filled in all the stuff. All this work by my 82 year old was surprising because he acted like he was 40. Not possible to accomplish this without him . Filled in the area with dirt and had a friend bring over new dirt to fill in some spots. Then the job was to spread grass seed and cover and wait for the grass to grow. Finally had to appear in court because the work was delayed util I could get help. I had to pay a fine for the violation of town ordinance in the first place. What a colossal and expensive pain in the ass. Had to pay the digging guy and owed my neighbor big favors too.  I would not want to do this again ever.","label":1}

I did a lot of research and started talking to others that I trust. I went with my mom to as many doctor's appointments as possible. I was there with her through her surgery and the news that it was an aggressive form of cancer and that if it hadn't been found soon it would have been a lot worse. She went through a week of radiation. She did overall well. Soon after we found out that chemo was recommended to help greatly reduce the risk of recurrence. At first it was emotionally hard because I could only think about seeing my mom without hair and possibly weak. Now I realize that I will stand behind my mom and her decisions.

{"text":"Dear Diary,I spoke to Grandma today or at least I tried to. I will admit that I don't go to visit her nearly as much as I should in the nursing home but to be honest it really just breaks my heart to do so. She seems so miserable and she looks so unhealthy. She's lost so much weight and her hair has gotten so white and thin. It's hard to look at this sickly and frail old woman and try to equate her with the strong and sweet woman that I grew up with. Living over an hour away most of our conversations have had to be over the phone and maybe that's just better for us both. Sometimes when I do visit she cries a lot and I feel so awful because there's nothing I can do to alleviate her sadness and pain. I was working from home today and my mom called to tell me that she was visiting Nana and that Nana wanted to talk to me. I've always been a really literal person so I pay a lot of attention not only to what people say but how they say it. She didn't say that she wanted me to talk to Nana, but that Nana wanted to talk to me. Which meant that she asked my mom to contact me. I know this might not seem like a big deal to most people, but it really was a huge deal to me because Nana has had a series of strokes over the past few years and her speech never truly recovered from the last one. Communicating is extremely frustrating for her as well as us. So that means that she was able to communicate well enough that my mother was able to understand what she wanted her to do. So, I told my mom to go ahead and put her on the phone. As soon as I heard her voice filter through the headset, I greeted her warmly and asked if the hospital staff was treating her well. She started trying to say something and was stammering really badly. Knowing that this is the point in which she usually gets frustrated and gives up, I encouraged her to think very carefully about what she wanted to say and try again. We went through that for several minutes before she could finally get out the words that \"She had me on her mind and she just wanted to tell me that she loved me.\" The rest of our conversation was pretty much me guessing what she was trying to convey and her either confirming or denying that my guess was right. I remain astounded that those words were completely clear and everything else she said was gibberish. It was as if she had said the most important thing and was ok with everything else being muddled.","label":1}

After about 4 years of on and off trying to go to classes, and my symptoms becoming more apparent and dictating my life's choices. For 3 weeks I stayed in a park, hiding as best I could, and coming to near starvation. I found out from another homeless vet that although there weren't any shelters or food cupboards I could go to without a referral near by to where I was, I could always travel the 25 miles to go to the VA where they would place me in housing of some kind. So I finally did, and they put me in a recovery program for the homeless, mentally ill, and drug addicted vets of LA.  It turned out I was much worse outside and it was apparent to others how much worse I was doing mentally, than I was aware of on the inside - and the VA very quickly approved not only the increase to my disability benefits, going from 50% service connected to 100%, and also paying for my shelter stay on a 3 month basis, with a second manager from the VA coming to check on progress and whether I needed the continued shelter. Of course, this was great news, but I was still new to medication and therapy, and I was in an extremely self destructive and self hating place. I wanted to kill myself, I thought about it daily, I didn't think there was any hope, so when the good news came in, it barely registered in my mind. Just like my physical shape \u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00ac going from 220 pounds at 15% body fat to 400 pounds in under 3 years \u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00ac I was nearly unaware of my circumstances changing. And the VA paid me 15000 dollars in back pay from when I submitted the increase in benefits. Looking back, I wish I has been ready to leave then. But I wasn't. And over that year, I ate nearly 30000 in fast food, almost never leaving my room, and eventually breaking my leg with how overweight I got. In May of this year my time ran out. I had been on medication for nearly 6 months, and it had started helping a ton. No more panic attacks when I didn't go outside. Very little suicidal thoughts on a day to day. And my new case manager had helped me come up with great coping mechanisms for when I left. And so I did. I left for Florida, where my son is, and I've been living here since. I've dropped 40 pounds, I go on walks daily, I'm eating less than 1500 calories a day, and swimming multiple times a week, and now even working online with amazon mturk. I have my own apartment, I shop by myself, I cook on my own, don't eat any fast food, and soon, I hope to be in my sons life.","label":1}
{"text":"A few months ago I had a heart attack even though I am only 40 years old, never smoked, not overweight, or any other risk factors. At first I thought it was just heartburn and went to the doctor and she ran some tests and assured me it wasn't my heart. But after a few days the pain was still there and never went away and finally i went to the ER. They ran an EKG. They saw I was having a heart attack and did a stint. They found out I was 100% in my main incoming artery which normally kills people outright so its a bit of a miracle that I didn't die or suffer any heart damage. After a few days in the hospital they put me on lots of new medications and sent me home. I was in a lot of pain and had lots of bruising from the stent. Then I had to go to 3 months or rehab afterwards. Rehab was very difficult and scary. I was around a lot of sick people twice my age. i had to learn to trust my heart again and push my body to workout even though it scared me. I also had to change my diet to be low-fat. some days I feel blessed to have gone through what I did and survived with no damage. Some days I feel cursed to have this happen to me when I did everything right.","label":1}

{"text":"Several months ago, I lived in what could only be described as a haunted house. It was located in Southern Colorado. My husband and I were needing a home and looking for a rental property, and this was a charming old house that was built in the late 1800's. Our landlord disclosed to my husband (not to me), that a previous tenant had committed suicide shortly before we were to move in. Knowing that we were already locked in and ready to move, my husband decided not to tell me about the situation for fear I would back out of the deal. It wasn't until we moved in and were settled that he shared the secret with me. The room that the tenant had killed herself in was my new office, and I had always had trouble breathing in there. There is no way to describe it other than the air was constantly sucked out of the room, so that if you were in there for any length of time with the windows and door closed, you literally could not breathe and would feel very faint, as though you needed oxygen or were going to black out. The first month we lived there, we would leave the light over the sink in the kitchen on. It would cut out at several second intervals throughout the night, which I could always see from my position in the bedroom while trying to go to sleep. It would render the house completely dark, and was unnerving. We decided to move out after two months because of the...unrest...that was felt there. Everyone who came into the house could feel the heaviness and the difficulty breathing. IT turned out that the previous tenant had overdosed, purposely, on Klonopin and suffocated in her sleep. This lack of being able to breathe was the most terrifying and memorable event from living there. I still believe this house was haunted.","label":1}
{"text":"On a cold morning three years ago, I received a call that I knew was not going to end well. I woke up that morning as usual, got dressed and was about going out foe work. I received a call from my sister that my cousin had fainted that morning. We all grew up together, and the said cousin grew up with us in the same house, so I regard her as more of a blood sister than a cousin. Immediately after I received the call, I called into work to tell inform that I would not be coming in that day for family emergency reasons. Shortly after, I drove to the hospital were she was admitted. When I arrived at the hospital, my sister was already there along side with most of the patients family members. We were all worried sick for her because there were no apparent symptoms, and according to her husband she slept very well the previous night. After a while, the test results were in and it was determined that she had brain cancer. We were all scared for her, but it was also our duty to remain strong for her. Over the next couple of weeks and months, we tried to encourage her to fight and remain strong. She first started with chemotherapy, which was not doing her much good. She then opted to have a surgery. The surgery ended up been more complicated than we expected, but after all the surgeries, she continued chemo. At this point we thought she was in a good place, and that she was recovering. A few weeks later she died. It came as a surprise to all her well wishers because we genuinely thought she was getting better. Two days before her death, she went out with her husband and kids, and they had some fun. Her death was really disturbing and unbelievable.","label":0}

The wedding was beautiful it had all this flowers and decorations that made the place very lovely, and very happy itself. The people were all dancing and everybody was dressed very fancy where you can tell the wedding was for refined tastes. Personally I don't like dressing fancy normally but it looked very good with me. But what was more surprising was since the wedding took place out of the city we had a unexpected guest. It was a rattle snake and it almost bite me if it wasn't for another person that catch it, I don't know what would have happened. Therefore it could have deadly. Thank goodness I was safe from the snake. Everything went normally afterwards and we ended the night on a high note. It was a experience that you would never forget about the wedding. It makes me want to get married one day. It's a relief that now you can marry who you want. I am a very envious men.","label":1}

I guess we all think this way though until it happens to us. The thing that hurts the most though is not just the fact that he has committed adultery but the length of time that its been going on. I guess looking back I should have known but I never questioned his late nights. I never questioned those weekends away. I trusted him wholeheartedly. I think now I just feel so foolish. Did he ever laugh at me knowing what he was doing behind my back. That thought hurts so much too. I am trying to come to terms with all this. He has asked for forgiveness but given the length of time he has been doing this I feel like its unforgivable.

{"text":"Recently, about 3 months ago I took on my largest cake order so far.  I run a small business fro home baking cakes, cookies, cupcakes and the like, until this all of my orders had been relatively small orders. It was for a dear friends brother's wedding, it was a large three tier cake, and I was nervous but I felt like I should take it on. The cake design its self was one that was difficult, square, which is difficult for me because in needs crisp edges, covered in handmade flowers, and wrapped in a black ribbon. The act of getting it to the wedding venue its self was gong to be stressful because it had to be transported in the heat of the summer in the south. I also felt that their wedding was a little unorganized but I felt that they were a great couple to do my first wedding cake fo rdue to the fact that they were laid back and very understanding people. I was so nervous, I started working as far ahead as I could and researched the best ways to transport and stack the cake. The day before I prepared the cake and had everything ready, and my nerves were a wreck. My husband and I laid down to go to bed, at three in the morning we got a phone call. My father in lay had a heart attack and was in critical conditions, my husband rushed to get his things together and make the drive 2 states away. So now I had to figure out how to pack me and 2 children and my husband enough stuff to last however long we might need to be there and deliver a wedding cake with 2 small children in tow. I was now officially a nervous wreck, I called the lady who was planning the wedding, and told her I needed to deliver the cake as early as I could, I packed all of our clothes, and the cake in the car with my 2 and 6 year old and headed towards the church. I managed to set up the cake and prepare it for the bride in 20 minutes and head towards my father in law. I had to leave the church before the bride was even able to come see the cake. I then drove 4 hours with two little kids to meet my husband. Thankful my father in law is on the mend but that was an extremely stressful day. The bride ended up being very happy with the cake as well and the wedding has gotten me several other orders.","label":1}
{"text":"I finally took the next step in my career at the beginning of July when I landed a new job. I had been stuck in a more entry-level IT job for three years, during which time I never got any promised raises. I even took a slight pay cut to start a career in IT after having been in print media layout for two decades. I have been looking for awhile, and came close to great jobs twice, but I never got out of that rut before now. I worked very hard sending out more than 100 resumes in my area and in other cities in Tennessee and even Florida. Finally, a small local company noticed my resume on a job site and called me. Initially, I was worried about this job because I couldn't see if it was right for the next phase in my career. But I figured I should interview, if for no other reason than I needed the practice for other job opportunities. When I went to the first interview, I liked the company, and I saw that I could use a variety of IT disciplines. The primary job is hardware\/software help desk, but I get to use my data and networking skills too. I agreed to a second interview, but I needed a big increase in pay. I got the job offer, which was $50 more a week. However, I got another $70 a week for healthcare. My wife carries our insurance, so the overall effect is $120 per week. I jumped on the job and have loved it. I cut my commute by almost 60 miles a day, and I have almost 1.5 hours more that I am not spending driving to and from work. I also feel a lot better since I don't spend most of the day dreading being at work. I am so happy I found this new job.","label":1}

{"text":"There are some memorable days in my life and they remain ever green in my heart. My first day of school is such a day. It was the month of January 2003. I was then only six years old. My father proposed that i should be admitted into a school in class on the next day. I felt very excited i could not think of anything else. I was always thinking about the school, the teachers, as i watched on TV. I could not even sleep well that night. The next morning my mother woke me early in the morning, she wash me very well, comb my hair and dress me in new clothes. Then i had breakfast and started for school with my father. He took me to the nearest CFB primary school of our locality at 9:30 am. The school was not very far from our home, so we walk all the way, it took us about 30 minutes to get to the school. When i stepped into the school compound with my father i was somewhat afraid. I saw many student s on the school campus, some were playing some where talking to each other. Finding myself in a new environment my heart started to beat, at first my father took me to the headmaster's room and request him to admit me in one grade, i was nervous but his smiling face and and gentle eyes put me to ease. He asked me my name and i answered him. then he pointed me a letter chart and ask me to say some letters. I could say them all because my mother taught me how to say it at home. Then he became very pleased at me and admitted me to one grade, then he called Ms Fatema the one grade teacher to take me to class. When i entered the class all the students in the class where staring at me, i felt a bit nervous once again to see the new faces, i sat down and at my leisure period, all my classmate started playing in the field, i felt very lonely and was loitering here and there, then they invited me to join them, i started playing, i felt myself like a free bird flying in the open sky. My school ends at 12pm, my mother was at the gate to receive me. I leapt into her arms she kissed me caught me at her arms. That was how i spent my first day of school. I left the school with a new experience and a cheerful mind. I shall never forget that day as long as i live.","label":1}

{"text":"Several months ago myself along with several others flew to Oregon to backpack along the PCT, the Pacific Coast Trail. We had all just turned 18 and were looking for something to together before we all left for university. The PCT is over 2000 miles long stretching from Canada all the way to Mexico and takes at least 6 months to complete. Our goal was to complete the Oregon section and backpack all the way across Oregon into Washington in 3 weeks or less. We grossly underestimated our task. Our first challenge arose just minutes after landing in the small municipal airport 30 minutes from the trail head. We needed to find someone to drive us to the trail head before nightfall, which was quickly approaching. We found someone willing to take the 6 of us in a minivan the 30 minutes to the trail head. The unfortunate part was that our driver had no idea where the trail start was - and neither did we. He ended up dropping us off on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere, just an hour before sunset. What we had though was the start to the trail ended up being just a game trail. We were lost in a foreign state, in the middle of nowhere with no signal to use GPS, the sun setting behind us. So we picked a direction and started walking down the gravel road. Several miles later of the same landscape along with the now high moon lighting the road, we flagged down a passing truck, the first person we had seen in hours. We explained to him what we were doing and that we were lost, he told us to keep walking down the road and we will eventually find a sheriffs station who can help us out. He also made sure to remind us of the impossibility of our goal and that we should just go home. Later in the night, closer to 1 am we came across a group of rangers performing a search and rescue, we again explain our situation and after their several minutes of amusement at our situation they tell us that the trail is less than a mile up a nearby path. They kindly give us some food and water along with a map and send us on our way. We reached the trail head that night and went on to complete the rest of the Oregon section within 3 weeks - probably to the surprise of the man in his truck. There were many other adventures and memories had within that time, but that is for another essay.","label":1}

This was a man she was quite close to as she spent a lot of her summers growing up with her grandparents.  It had happened suddenly, so she didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  A couple days after this call, she came over, dark circles under her eyes.  She asked if I would go to the funeral with her as she didn't think she could go without me.

I can only hope that when my time comes, I have made enough impact positively on the world to have the same turnout.  It was a very sad, but memorable time in my life.","label":0}
{"text":"Dear Diary,I finally got back for my 6 month hiatus and really had a blast! I traveled all around the world, and even took one of those 28 day cruises across the Mediterranean down around India to Australia! I had been yearning to travel for a while, and now that I have seen so much in the last year, the world has certainly been a lot smaller. My first stop was in Europe. Specifically, Paris. While I started there, most of what I saw was just too touristy. Everything was extremely overpriced and I just wasn't feeling the culture, so after two weeks in Paris, I took a train across Europe intending on hitting as many cities as possible. About halfway through my trip, I found myself in Rome. Now Rome is incredibly beautiful and culturally rich. I really enjoyed seeing the Colosseum, and for the most part, it seemed less tourist based than a few of the other cities I encountered. I just really like the culture and history of the Roman period, so learning about that was fantastic. It was kind of crazy to consider how much of our society is structured around the politics of the Roman Republic. I was able to schedule a cruise while I was there, and it picked us up on the Italian coast. We went from Italy through the Mediterranean, making quite a few stops along the way. I think there were about 12-14 excursion ports? It was a very long trip that ended in Australia. While I was in Australia, I met a woman who had a wildlife sanctuary and she invited me to her place to see the kangaroos and koalas she had been rehabilitating. I had never seen a koala up close and personal before but she said they can be a little grouchy. I didn't have a chance to experience a grouchy koala though because they were all drugged up on eucalyptus. I stayed in Oz for about a month, and then I ended my travels by going to New Zealand and then Thailand before catching a flight back home. It was an incredible and unique experience that helped me relate a bit more to numerous cultures and people. I'm so glad I went.","label":0}
{"text":"The last 5 months have been a dream come true. My house is so old but was a great buy because it was advertised as a \"fixer-upper\". After the first couple of years it didn't seem like it was such a great buy after all. I invested a lot of time and money in working on it but I finally ran out of both. The bathroom was the biggest embarrassment and definitely had an impact on my social activities. As far as I was concerned the loose tiles, mildew stained walls and ancient sink, commode and bathtub was something I could live with but after a humiliating experience with a friend who dropped me off after a lunch date and asked to use the bathroom, a re-model soared right up to the top of the to-do list. She opened the door, walked inside, turned around and came back out immediately announcing that she didn't have to \"go after all\" and left. I refused to have anyone over and as a result, invitations to friend's houses came less and less frequently. I even overheard two friends say they wondered why I always came to their houses but never \"returned the favor\". The re-model was costly but the transformation was amazing. My bathroom looks like something from House Beautiful. The new fixtures, wall coverings, shower enclosure and lighting are incredible. I'm back on the \"social scene\" after a few get-together's and my self-confidence is back. It's so true that one's home tells so much about who you are. Now that I'm proud of my surroundings I feel like that's just the beginning of endless possibilities.","label":0}

{"text":"Back in April of this year I experienced my first brush with having a nervous breakdown due to a toxic work environment.  I worked in neuropsychological assessment, so I had patients that were rude, abrasive, and abusive, with no support from management.  I was in a room with no windows and bright florescent lights six to eight hours a day.  I did this for five years.  In March, I had the opportunity to go on a month-long trip to Thailand and Japan.  During that month, I clearly noticed the difference in my mood and behaviors.  I was more resilient, more optimistic, and I felt supported by my travel companions.  I also had a lot of new experiences, and adventure is important to me.  I came back with a renewed sense of self and a mindset that I knew would help me cope with the stresses at work.  Unfortunately, it took only four days before I was in my small, windowless dungeon shaking and crying.  That day, something in my mind broke.  It was the most clarity I've felt about my life since being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008.  I knew I could no longer do that job.   That continuing to do that job would affect my health adversely.  I wrote my resignation letter the next day.  After that, I've read a lot of articles on recovering from burnout and self-care.  It's been a challenging yet satisfying road since I left.  I'm losing weight, I'm recovering my sense of self and learning more about my boundaries.  All in all, it was the right decision.  I wish I had done it two years earlier.","label":1}
{"text":"I experienced the death of my two in laws and my dad within last six months. It was totally unexpected and it just came so suddenly. All three of them were in fair health condition before, but their health suddenly deteriorated so badly that led to their death. I felt so hopeless and unprepared. It seemed like we just talked not too long ago, but suddenly you just could not see the person again forever! Having someone so close to you passed away made you sad and rethink the meaning of life. What is most important? What would you want to do if this is your last moment? We just cannot waste time on trivial things, because we can die any moment! It does't matter whether you are old or young. Life is really short and unexpected , and we need to cherish every moment of it. I want to spend more time with my loved ones, and make more memory. Also, I want to go with my hearts to do what I like. Stop complaining and just act! You never know what your last moment will come, and hopefully, I live to the fullest of life before the end of it.","label":1}
{"text":"Cannabis has been proven to help people with many medical conditions live more comfortably. In addition, our society has become so complex and stressful that many people need a way to manage their anxiety and stress. Smoking a joint or eating an edible helps them calm down, thereby decreasing the chance that they will become unruly or take their anger out on others. Still others want to party on their days off to blow off steam. By legalizing cannabis, all who want it can safely buy it without fear of arrest, and a lower cost than if it were illegal.","label":0}
{"text":"Today, I had a very interesting thing happen to me at work. It involved something that I was hoping that might happen a little later down the line in my career. I guess it was one of those things that really takes you by surprise when it happens a lot sooner than expected. I was pulled aside by my Operations Manager for a little chat. We mainly talked about usual work related stuff and such, nothing too out of the ordinary. He twas telling me about a new position that had opened up for the current lead on the team and that they would be moving on to a different account. I was thought that this was good for them and mentioned that I hope they did well in their new position. My boss then says that it would obviously open up a new spot and that they would need to get someone new to come in. He asked what I thought about this and I just said that I wasn't sure at the moment but that I thought one of my other colleagues could probably step into the position. Then out of no where he just says that he's going to give it to me. At first I thought he was joking but then I saw that he appeared to be serious. I was a little caught off guard by this because I thought that some of the others might be better suited to step into this position. He basically told me that he thought that I had been doing such a good job and that I had shown the ability to do the job. I still felt a little uneasy about it but at the same time I knew that I could take on the challenge if I put the effort into it. I told him that I would gladly accept and that I would do my best. That was the very surprising and super exciting highlight from my day today.","label":1}

{"text":"I spoke with Derek again today and he's doing better. His cast comes off in another couple of days and he's excited to get to walk without crutches. The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.","label":0}
{"text":"So, I had a bad couple of weeks recently.  One morning, I woke up and did my normal morning routine.  I heard the neighbors upstairs getting ready to leave, as usual.  A few minutes after I heard the mom and kid leave, I heard a really loud noise from up there.  I thought maybe the boyfriend had dropped something heavy.  I didn't think too much of it because I heard footsteps afterward and figured all was well.  About 5 to 10 minutes later, there was loud banging on my front door and people yelling outside.  The apartment above mine was on fire and I had to get my son up and get out. It seems as though the neighbor's boyfriend did something to set the fire, which is probably the noise I had heard.  It burned really hot and fast.  My apartment became unlivable due to water and smoke damage, so we were forced to move to another apartment.  We are now almost settled into our new apartment.  It has been difficult to manage, and we still need to replace some of the furniture we lost.  We could have filed a personal property insurance claim, but most of what was lost wasn't really worth anything since it was second-hand older items for the most part. I can't help but to keep thinking about it.  I wonder what might have happened if I had slept late that day.  I don't know that we would have been okay if I wasn't awake, or if it had burned just a little faster.","label":1}

{"text":"Back in July, I was at work getting my day started. I decided to log into Facebook while I had my coffee. While scrolling through my feed I saw an update that my old work colleague had made. I worked with him at my previous job and considered him one of my closer friends that I left there. I had definitely fallen out of touch and had not seen or heard much from him. His post was about his weekend with his kids and how much his family meant to him. at the time I was leaving that job he had just welcomed his new baby girl and was very excited for this chapter of his life. I decided to shoot him a message to let him know it looks like things are going well. He responded quickly and told me everything is going very well but that's he was at the end of his rope with his job. He was interested to know how I was liking my new workplace so I told him I couldn't be happier with the move, I just wished I could have taken some of my team with me. Later that day when I was talking to my boss, the topic of new projects was brought up. It look like for the next year our calendar was full of new work. I said, \"Are these projects going to increase our headcount at all? This is quite a bit of work our small team.\" She said we'd be looking to hire at most one to two more people for full-time positions. The timing of these events seemed serendipitous. I told her I knew the perfect person that she needed to interview. \"Great! I'll let you know when the position is posted so we can bring them in for an interview.\"","label":1}
{"text":"I have had my cat for ten years.  When I got her she was such a breath of fresh air.  I was going through a depression and she really helped perk me up.  I mean, who can stay depressed when you have all of that kitten energy going on in your life?  I loved her so much.  When I would go through a hard day she was always there to make me feel better.  I first noticed her not feeling well about a year ago.  I took her right to the vet.  At first, they gave her some medicine and told me to watch her.  I was anxious at first but then I was elated that she started to get better.  But it didn't last long.  After an initial uptick in health, it took a bad turn for the worse and I could see tumors forming.  I panicked and took her in.  I didn't have the money for the vet so I put it on a credit card and I felt thankful to have good credit so I could help her.  I paid for a biopsy of the tumors.  The biggest moment of this experience was when the vet asked me to come in to hear the results instead of giving me the results of the biopsy over the phone.  At this moment I felt so anxious and I knew it was bad news.  When I came in they said that she had a very aggressive form of feline cancer.  Her chances, especially at her age, were not good.  Chemo treatments would cost thousands, be very painful and probably would not work.  I hated that I was considering money as one of the factors.  I didn't have thousands and it looked like it would not work.  I mean, if this was my child and it kind of is, I would say that I didn't want to pay the moeny.  In the end the doctor helped me by recommending to put her to sleep which I did.  After I oddly felt at peace knowing that she lead a good life and was no longer in pain.","label":0}

{"text":"I rented the cabin out on Thunder Lake a few weeks ago.  I thought it would be a lot of fun to get all of the families together.  So I went ahead and rented a pretty large cabin.  It was really cool, the kitchen was wide open with a lot of windows looking out over the lake.  There were plenty of bedrooms for everyone so both my parents and my inlaws came along, along with our kids and some of their friends.  We all wanted to get out on the water and we rented some kayaks to use while we there.  Everyone was taking turns and having fun but my mother-in-law refused to try it.  Finally after a lot of pushing by just about everyone, she finally decided to give it a try.  It was so funny she was really pretty freaked out about the entire thing.  But she got in the kayak just fine and managed to have some fun kayaking along the shoreline.  It was hard not to laugh when she finished.  She got back to the dock and just stared at all of us.  She couldn't figure out the best way to climb back out of the kayak!  Some grandkids went over to help her.  They essentially had to pull her out.  We all got a good laugh out of it, even her.  It really was a great time and she thinks she may even kayak again sometime.","label":0}
{"text":"It's about my grandmother, mother of my mother.  She has altogether 25 grandchildren and I am probably the only one who grew under care or should I stay I stayed with her the longest duration of all children.  That's probably why she is very connected to me.  She was a robust woman from village in remote Nepal.  She was strong as an ox, never took a pill of a medication in her mouth.  But that one day, must be the fate, her dress got caught in something in the road and she fell.  Passerby in the street took her to the hospital.  Fortunately, the doctor treating her happened to be a friend of my elder sister so we came to know about it and we reached the hospital.  We found out she had a frontal hematoma that couldn't be fixed.  They said they will do everything in their power, but who are we kidding here, they are not god. They are trained professional who will try their best.  So the operation began to drain the blood.  Good thing, they drained it.  Bad thing, it couldn't be completely drained as it kept filling back.  With that complication, she lost her memory and was in a dementia-type state.  When she woke up after the operation, she did not recognize anyone and everyone in the room was crying.  That day, I had a meeting so I was the last one to reach there. When I entered the room, she called me by name and everyone was surprised.  That is the best moment in my life that out of that gloomy limbo and darkness, she still knew who I was.  I hugged her and I sat beside her telling her all the things she missed. The funny thing in that room was after she called out my name, all the other children, my cousins, they were crying not because they were sad about grandmother's state but because they were jealous, she knew only my name.  One week after that, she passed away peacefully in her sleep.  I didn't cry at all not because I didn't want to but because for some reason, I couldn't.  Still to this day, I am trying to find out why but still I think about her everyday but I never feel like crying.","label":1}
{"text":"I always wanted a house so when i got the chance to purchase one with the help of my dad i took the chance and went at it. The search was so hectic . I did not believe that it would be so much work and i did not believe there was so much paper work involved in it.  I went thru the process of getting a realtor then i got a listing of homes she gave me. I then went thru the homes listing carefully and picked the house that i think me and my wife would like . Most importantly it had to have a lard yard space meaning a large backyard that my kids can play in. We went to i would say about 12 houses before we got struck with excitement when we saw the house we wanted. It was absolutely not the biggest house but it was the perfect house and it certainly fits our needs. It had the perfect yard space and home was the perfect size, it was going to be easy for my wife to clean and it was going to be easy for me to clean the yard and maintain it.  We closed on the house and we moved everything in within a week or so. We then proceeded to decorate the house in our favorite color blue. After a month or so it was our son's birthday so we did a little party and invited a few friends. They came and told us and congratulated us and said how proud they were of us that we came a long way to when we use to live in the small apartment. I wanted to jump for joy but i showed no emotion but deep down i was super excited and happy that i could achieve something a lot of people cannot achieve these days because house prices are so expensive and people can barely afford their bills must less save for a house. I continue to take care and i continue to decorate my house the way we want it to look.

When I began this journey I had no idea how much work it would take and perhaps if I had known I may have followed another path, so I'm thankful that I didn't because it feels great to have made this accomplishment. I felt so proud when I received my diploma. It was such a thrill! I couldn't stop smiling. One thing I have to admit is I have been taken aback a bit by a feeling of almost loss. This...struggle has become almost a part of my identity and after finishing all this I feel almost as if I have lost a piece of myself. I find myself wondering what to do next. Having that single-minded focus for such a long time creates such a tunnel vision as to what comes after it has been a bit of an unexpected challenge emotionally. I'm trying to give myself time though. It's only been a week after all! That's not to say that I don't feel any sense of excitement about the future. Surely many opportunities have opened up to me with this achievement so I look forward to seeing what the next chapter of my life will be. I guess I go back and forth between these two feelings - loss and excitement. It's a little weird I guess.","label":0}

She's been to school before, VPK but that is different. Small class, I walk her in and out and it's only 4 hours a day. She was just 4, likely the youngest of the entire class.

Her teacher Ms. Huffmann is kind and clearly capable of creating an environment for these little people to feel safe. I was so proud of G's bravery and sense of adventure. She made friends, played on the playground and loved lunchtime! She couldn't wait to go back. We're in our third week now and I couldn't be more excited for her.

She had no reason to trust us but she did anyways.  I still remember that moment when she rolled over for her first ever belly rub.  Today Elsa had a grand mal seizure and afterwards she was clearly in a lot of pain.  Her foster mom called me since I am one of her trusted people and I rushed over.  What really made an impression on me was how many people did the same thing.  8 other people drove over an hour to come help Elsa & her foster.  Elsa didn't just change my life or her fosters life.  She changed the life of a whole group of people who couldn't be more different from each other.  It's pretty amazing to think that a dog can do that.

{"text":"In June, I went to a family reunion. It was held at the home of my cousin's former husband in New Jersey. Last year, he came and picked up me and my partner at our place in New York and drove us there. This time, although one of the cousin's organizing the event said she'd try to arrange transportation, she was unable to do so, so we took the bus. This involved taking the subway to Port Authority in Manhattan, then a bus to New Jersey, then calling my cousin on arrival to have someone pick us up. The whole trip should have take a couple of hours. I looked at Google Maps before leaving the house, and planned our route. We left the house in ample time to catch the bus suggested by the app. On the way to the bus, I called my cousin to confirm that we were on our way. I found out that the host of the party said we should take a different bus, which was a route run by a different bus company. Naturally, this ran on a different schedule. When we arrived at the terminal, we found we'd have to wait an hour for our bus. When we finally got on the bus, we were relieved, and figured we see everyone in about an hour's time. Were we mistaken! We hit one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered. The trip took well over two hours. By the time we arrived, some of the guests were already leaving. The best part of the whole party was that one of my cousins had come all the way from Massachusetts. She had told me about a year ago that she loves coconut flan. So, I made it and did not tell her.

We had been joking about sex, and the sizes of certain people's equipment, and to prove a long-forgotten point her hand yanked down my trunks, and our friends had a hearty laugh at my expense.  I had not seen her since that day. I heard she had spent some time in Australia, working on a research vessel. About 4 months ago some ocean engineering student I know had built an Island in the middle of a lake they had created for a project. to inaugurate the island they were going to throw a party one afternoon. I was invited and I arrived at about 1 PM. the only way to get to that island was on a raft pulled along by a string above. while I was standing around nursing my beer, a darkly tanned blonde woman came up to me and asked me if I remembered her. I looked at her blankly for a moment.\"Ph-ph-Phillipa?,\" I stammered. To make a long story short it was. But this was not the Phillipa that I remembered. The Phillipa that I remembered was pudgy, whiny, fat-armed, stoop-shouldered and forgettable. This tall woman was commanding, lanky, graceful, gorgeous and apprised me confidently with the bluest eyes I think I had ever seen. One thing lead to another and we went for a walk along the ocean. The night ended long before the walk did.","label":0}
{"text":"I have never been one to believe in aliens. Every time classmates talked about it in school, I would laugh at them. I would laugh very loud. Suffice to say, no one told me that they believed in aliens because I would laugh in their face about it. One day, we were driving home, and my friends and I saw something in the sky. Could it be? My friend had binoculars, and when I looked through them, it wasn't shaped like an airplane or a drone. It really looked like a saucer was flying through the sky. We pulled over, stopped, and filmed it before we lost sight of it. Since we had some clear video of this potential UFO, my friend uploaded it on YouTube. Within a day, news stations were getting in contact with him to see if they can use his footage in their news broadcast. He was taken back. His video went viral and thousands of people saw it. Talk about sheer luck. That day, I became a believer in aliens and UFO.","label":0}
{"text":"Six months ago,my sister and I went on vacation. We decided to go to Mexico because it really is not far from where we live but yet it is a very different place to visit once you are there. We had decided that Mexico City was the most interesting place that we could visit. We had heard that there were some dangers in the country but where we were going,it was fairly safe. The problems for us started when we got off our plane. Our brochure said that there was a place that we could rent a car near the airport and we were walking to that location when we thought we noticed someone following us from a distance. When we arrived at  the place that was supposed to be a place that rented cars we soon found out that it was a parking lot that looked like at one time they could have rented cars.                               In our confusion we barely noticed that the car we thought might have been following us was slowing to a stop and had another car with it. We only paid so much attention until the men in the cars started to get out. There were a total of four men and we did not know any of them but they were placing all of their attention on us. We had been warned about dangers in country and how human trafficking and coyotes had become prominent in many places. This is where we realized that the men were together in looking for subjects that were not familiar with where they were and had no real way out.                                  That is when the driver of the white car grabbed my sister by her arm really hard and began to pull her towards his car with all his strength. I ran to him and hit him in his head as hard as I could with hope to stop him from taking my sister. Of course,by this time she is yelling at the top of her lungs and the other three guys are jumping on me to stop me from hurting their friend. As a result,there was an attendant at the lot that overheard her screams. He called the local police to get help to us because he was fenced in the lot he could not do anything else.                                     Thanks to my training with former CIA agents who were my friends,all of my instincts merged together with memory of training. I did a spinning back fist and knocked the first guy to the ground. The next acted as if he wanted to go toe to toe,so my first combination started with a left fake pump followed by an overhand right that he was unprepared for,this smashed his nose and knocked him out. The third guy was scared ,since he refused to get to close I jumped in to the air,kicked him so hard in the temple that he lost consciousness immediately. And as I spun around to face my final opponent,the police sirens scared the guy off that had a hold of my sister,he ran. The three that were at the scene were arrested and the other got away thanks to law enforcement. The police took us back to the airport and we went home.","label":0}

{"text":"Over the past year I have been involved with a court situation involving my daughter and my granddaughter. Unfortunately she hasn't been able to care for her in the right way, due to mental health issues. This resulted  in my granddaughter's removal from my daughter's home. My granddaughter was placed in my temporary care for the past 12 months. I have tried over the last year to work on building a trusting relationship with my daughter and work with her to make sure she is seeing her daughter often. We have gone to family therapy and learned to communicate more effectively. There had been many times where this was painful to watch my daughter have emotions of loss and try to convince her that I had to look out for my granddaughter as well. As part of the court proposal they suggested I become guardian. My daughter was not willing to agree to this. This would mean there was a chance my granddaughter could be put into the foster system. We had court on May 7th the day before my 49th birthday.  I was sure my daughter would not agree to guardianship. When the lawyers went in front of the judge my daughter had agreed that she would allow me to have guardianship. This was emotional because I felt sad for my daughter that she knew she would not get her daughter back if had gone to trial. On the other hand I felt a great relief that my daughter trusts me enough that I will make sure she has as much time with her daughter to keep their relationship alive in the hopes that some day she will be able to have her back.","label":1}
{"text":"Back in February my long time girlfriend and I moved from Boston to New Mexico. Santa Fe, specifically. The journey was 2,500 miles, and we drove. We took out cat with us, in a large dog crate we purchased, after we read about a lot of animals dying on plane rides. We split the journey into 8 hour days. We would stop and get food on the road, most of the time. We drove west. The sun was constantly in our eyes. We drove through PA, OH, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas. It was fun, but definitely the most enjoyable part was when we got out of middle America. We went to motel 6, because they allow pets. Our cat did surprisingly well. She slept for most of the journey. This event was significant to me because it signaled a new era in my life. It signaled a new time for me, and an attempt to be truly happy for my later years, though I am only in my 30s.","label":1}

{"text":"Several months ago, for an international vacation, I decided to travel to France for ten days. I traveled there with my brother and a close friend and we spent the whole time relishing the change in scenery and culture. While staying there, I got in touch with a friend of mine on social media that had been my best friend throughout my entire youth. Through our back-and-forth chats, I discovered that she was visiting her sister in a small city rather near where we were staying. Immediately, we were both enthused about the possibility of reconnecting and didn't want to miss such a surprising opportunity. The vacation was nearing its end, but I decided to extend my stay there by five days since I didn't need to return to work for another week and I could spare the expenses. My brother and friend returned home on a flight the next day. The following day, we decided to meet at a local cafe. The cafe was a beautiful little countryside shop that was surrounded by some stunning scenery. I arrived first, but only had to wait for five minutes or so. We picked a table outside, which made for a very pleasant experience due to the lovely weather and tranquility. Somehow, despite having hardly spoken for eight years aside from a message or two, we reconnected so easily. Our conversation wasn't the least bit awkward or stilted even at the beginning and we fell back into a sort of easygoing, lighthearted rhythm remarkably naturally. After a small lunch, we spent the rest of the day traveling by train through the countryside. We talked and laughed and shared numerous stories about our lives over the years. Nothing felt difficult to talk about and the depth of our friendship seemed to have never left, as though it would be able to survive anything. We said goodbye to each other that night, but met up again two days afterward and spent the majority of my remaining time there together. Aside from the reformation of a wonderful friendship, the whole experience was one of the most transformative of my life. It reawakened my creativity and love of life to an extent that few other things ever had. It also emphasized the importance of maintaining my relationships throughout life. We parted in great spirits and have kept in contact regularly ever since.","label":1}

She suggested I get a find needle aspiration done to her lymph node to have it tested right away.  I had to wait a few days only to find out it was inconclusive.  I had to bring her back in for minor surgery so they could pull a piece of lymph node out and test the tissue.  One full week later and a lot of worry and sleepless nights I get a call. she's not sick.  She doesn't have cancer. She has a rare deformity that even the vets can't even explain fully.

We got the picnic set up and I sat down to eat. I noticed that he did seem a little different than usual. I thought he was just super excited to be in Yosemite. He told me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. I was very thrilled to hear that. We then spoke about where and how we would like our wedding to be.

{"text":"I have always had issues with anxiety ever since I was very young, always worrying about all sorts of things. This, unfortunately, has led to me experiencing relatively frequent panic attacks. A few weeks ago I had what I would call my most costly panic attack ever. I had been feeling under the weather around that time and it didn't seem like I was getting any better. I had already been to the doctor twice in two weeks, but the doctor told me that all of the tests came back negative for any of the likely causes. He said that it was likely just a cold that has been aggravated by stress and that it would resolve itself with time. I woke up one morning and felt worse than I have ever felt. This caused me to get my self very wound up and have another panic attack. Once I was able to gather myself, I drove myself to the emergency room. The doctor there conducted all of the basic tests and still nothing was out of the ordinary. Being panicked, I  insisted that something was wrong and asked if there were any other tests that they could run. The doctor said yes, but also informed me that my insurance would likely not cover the costs of the additional tests. Being so anxious and upset, I agreed to still have the tests, even though my savings weren't anything special. So they ran a few additional tests and everything still came back negative. I eventually was convinced to go home and once again, wait and see if things got better. Of course, within a few days I was feeling as good as new. I was incredibly relieved until I received my medical bills. It would wipe out all of my savings and force me to use a payment plan to cover all of my expenses.","label":0}

We were planning on camping more, but the boys complained too much the one time saying the ground was too hard and it was too cold out, so we got hotels the other nights.  For dinner when we camped we had veggie hot dogs and baked beans.  We bought some other things to go with the meal at a cute nearby store, but I forgot now what they were.

You see, I've been battling a myriad of cancers for almost nine years.  And, in April, my doctors informed me that they had done all the could and that I should enter hospice.  A week after this revelation, I accompanied my daughter, son-in-law to be, his mom, my elder daughter and her husband, to the park where they were to be married.  It was a beautiful, unseasonably mild and sunny, Spring day.  There was a small lake, with a beach where the ceremony was to take place.  My daughter wore her bridal veil as I walked her down the \"aisle\" of sand to the lake's edge.  A family Pastor shared some of his thoughts and prayers as I \"presented\" her to her beloved, tears in all of our eyes and immense joy in our hearts, for this moment.  Afterward, we went to their favorite restaurant, The Green Turtle, for a mock wedding luncheon.  Then, a few days later, as I prepared to leave for hospice, one of my doctors called.  They wanted to delay hospice and invited me to participate in an experimental regimen of new treatments.  By this time I had resolved that my life was ending and my soul was at peace.  My family said they would abide by whatever decision I chose.  In the end, I accepted the treatments.  They were profoundly invasive, painful...and miraculous.  For I was able to attend, and participate in, the actual events of June 18th, in all their glory and rejoice.  I'm now in partial remission and immensely thankful to be living, one day at a time.","label":1}
{"text":"My Sisters Unplanned Wedding & How It Ended Successfully. In the past 7 Months my sister called my mum and told her she was pregnant Previously before that concerned family member would ask her about how she was doing with her relationship and we would get no concrete answer from here nor neither has anyone seen a man with her. She is 34 and so not a baby or child that cant be with a man of her own. I was also chocked when i brief that she was pregnant, every member of the family became instantly concerned on whom who impregnated her was. My sister was very secretive and doesn't easily tell other about herself not even me nor our bother and she hardly keeps friends, so there was no way to understand her except by watching her. Finally she brought him home and my mother didn't waste time to tell her it was time to prepare for the wedding because in our family we don't allow ladies have babies before getting married. It first it looked like he wasn't ready and everybody was bothered and hoping he doesn't abandon my sister and run away. A week later he dialed in and requested the family audience for the introduction,he was invited over for a family dinner where he explained his reasoning and asked my mother to allow him marry my sister officially. The next day a day was picked and 3 weeks later the wedding will be done, i was so excited that finally my sister would get married and everyone will feel less bothered about her as we used to all the time. The wedding was unplanned for but no body cared or complained because we all understood what we are trying to achiever and it came into play. The wedding was intended to be a small gathering of only close family relatives on both bride and groom side but that was not the case. Many people not invited showed up at the event and we almost ran out of supply to entertain the guest, luckily it was near a restaurant and i took it as my responsibility to save the day. I walked into the restaurant and ordered all available dishes to be brought to the event premises before the the public addressing finished. Luckily i was right on time, and the restaurant food were used to complement the catering services food that was organized for the event. It was really a very hectic time for all the family members as we had less time to prepare for this great even we had always hoped for because my sister was the first born and she had 4 sibling and in which all are married. It was really a beautiful day and we all went home after the ceremony with joy in our heart like as if finally we discovered where heaven was and that day was the day we went there.","label":1}

{"text":"Earlier this year, I experienced a major leg injury. It wasn't just a simple injury either. This thing came out of nowhere and literally wiped me out. It happened shortly after a gym session which didnt seem like anything different. I did work a bit harder than usual that night but thats what I do to gain strength and improve my fitness levels. Later that night after feeling an odd feeling in my leg, I felt a crazy pop. It felt relived but then shortly afterwards, I couldnt walk. This was my righ leg and I was barely even able to press the gas pedal in my car to make it home. Pains and muscle spasms begin shooting throughout my entire leg but seemed to focus near the inner part of my knee. After making it home, I immediately began RICE. The next few days were literally hell! I couldnt shower, cook food, and could barely make it to use the bathroom. I lived in a basement apt as well at this time and definitely could not make it upstairs to leave. Not that I could drive anyway. Eventually I retrieved a set of crutches that made life so much better! However, I couldn't walk work nearly an entire month and am currently still recovering. Its been about 5 months since the incident. The worst part of it all is that I am a very active and healthy young male. I put a lot of focus on health and well being and understand human anatomy and physiology at a high level. So, without the use of a major limb really puts me in a strange situation. It has been an interesting experience as far as learning how to do things that I can't do anymore but I cant say that Ive been depressed or sad. I have definitely felt worried at times though.

{"text":"When my house burned down about 8 months ago, in April, I was devastated. I dialed 911 when I really smelled smoke strongly, but it took the fire department a very long time to get to our house. Due to this, almost everything was completely tarnished. I was completely devastated that I lost everything, but I retained the most important thing, and that is my family. I just cannot believe that this happened to us. The fire department later told us that it was due to a gas leak inside the house. If not for our smoke detectors, we would all almost certainly be dead. It is a horrifying thing to think about. Since then, I have encouraged all my friends to check smoke detector batteries. It is nothing to fool around with. I am trying to have an outlook on this event in a positive manner, and so far it has really been changing my life for the better. I am more faithful, I care more about others, I am more empathetic, and i have even started going to Church more. My family has begun the process of building a new house with the insurance money from the old house that burnt down. I am still extremely upset that i lost all of my possessions, but i have realized that family is far more important. I thank God every day that I am still here on earth.

The children have Irish ancestry from their father's side of the family, so they had a blast in Dublin. I wanted to go to Tenerife, Spain, and I think that the children had an even better time there.  Our favorite place we visited was a beach in Italy that sat on the Mediterranean. The children had never before seen a beach that had sea glass instead of sand. They spent hours just picking up sea glass and looking at it. The weather was absolutely perfect, but it was not warm enough to actually swim. We shared so many amazing memories with one another on the trip back home over the Atlantic. I know this was a trip of a lifetime, but I would love to be able to go back. My children will be thinking about this trip for the rest of their lives. Hopefully, when they're a little older, we can go back again and relive our dream vacation.","label":0}

There's a particular coworker that's also gone every year and this year we spent some time together, alone, doing activities and sightseeing outside of the work day. I've always felt an attraction to this coworker, but never acted on it. When we got back from NY, we continued to hang out, go out to eat, etc. Then we started a romantic relationship. I really enjoy his company and I think he feels the same. I was pleasantly surprised at how things evolved. I hope the relationship continues. I also hope that if it doesn't, our working relationship won't be affected. He's 22 years younger than me, yet there doesn't seem to be a problem with the age difference. We have a lot in common.

Good thing though once at the hospital they said another fifteen minutes and I would have been dead. I was given my first blood transfusion. Since then I have never been completely healthy. Fast forward to a few months ago I was fasting . I was to break my fast so I went shopping for chicken broth & vegetables. I had to sit down before I walked back home I was so dizzy & weak. It was extremely hot to add. I sat for maybe two hours then I fainted again ambulance was called and the process started all over again.

All there for the event that was about to take place, of which I would be on stage and having to face these strangers. It was nerve-wracking, but all my dedication had led me to this moment, this sensation of displaying my success in front of these thousands. It was Graduation Day, and nothing could have felt better than owning up to the last four years of my life, and seeing the fruit of that labor. The dean and president began their speeches, lovely poems and quotes about embracing the future making up the bulk. I couldn't see my family, however, I knew they would be looking for me once I am called to receive my diploma. The clapping that took place after the speeches could have triggered an earthquake, or maybe just my senses were heightened on this occasion. The air was crisp and cool, with the overcast sky darkening the ceremony it was very relaxing. I had done it, and now my life is truly ready to begin. What awaited, I did not know, and to be honest, I did not care. In that moment all that mattered was taking in the sights that are once in a lifetime.

Now I've cut my rent in half, and prices for groceries and gas are considerably cheaper outside the city. The greatest result of the move is that I've been able to start making hefty payments on my student loans. I've been waiting to do that for about 10 years. In addition to paying less for rent, I've also become more financially responsible. I even cut coupons. There was a time I would have died to hear myself say that!

It is some coincidence that we were at the right time and the right place to see the accident happen. I can't recall the last time I saw an accident happen as it must have been many years ago. However, I am glad that we were there so that we could offer help. One of the driver's was in bad shape and needed help. Being aware of the fear and panic that can cause bystanders from stepping in and helping during a crisis, we decided to get out to see if we could help save the driver. We are not sure if the person that came up to us for help was with the driver when the accident happened, but apparently she was a friend of the driver. She was noticeably panicking and losing control. Based on experience during a emergency, I knew the best thing for her to do was to be calm and rational. I tried to ease her nerves and offer her reassurance. She was grateful and wanted to contact us later. That ended up not happening as there wasn't anything in return that we were in need of. I wonder what happened to the driver and the driver's friend. I hope that they are okay and that they can avoid getting into accidents in the future.","label":0}

It was a casual early morning around 4:45am, i was leaving for work at the same time I usually leave. When I made it about 10 min away from my crib i realize i forgot my lunch, so i turned around figuring since i always get to work about 20 min early I have time to spare. So i turned back and grab my lunch and headed to work. Then i saw it was a car accident on the highway and realize this is major setback. I couldn't see what it was. Waiting, I eventually get closer and see that its a 18 wheeler truck, stuck in a ditch. Something clicked in my head like this going to be one of the worst days of my life. I called my manager to give them a heads up on the situation and they told me I'll be okay, so I'm  thinking \"I should be okay and have nothing to worry about\". I arrived to work 15 min late, grab my work equipment and headed to my location. I start working and i could see the GM passing by me just about every 30-45 min. Now I'm scared cause he doesn't come around unless there's a problem. So I'm shiver-en and panicking. I ask one of my co workers who was close to the manager and they responded that I was okay and he hadn't heard anything. I'm guessing I'm good then. The day is almost finish and I get a call from the manager telling to gather my gear so i can complete a survey and leave. I didn't think much of it cause surveys are common at my job. I walk to the office and I'm there with him and the GM, they tell me to sit. I knew it was bad news due to the fact the GM was there. I sat and just thought \"Say it\". They said it with no hesitation and my heart froze for 5 seconds, I'm crying on the inside but on the outside acting like I'm okay. I'm walked out the building in front of peers who are just staring at me I'm feeling embarrassed and shameful. I gave them the key to the locker and shook there hands and left.

{"text":"I have great memories of our family trip to Chicago, Illinois. It actually had an odd beginning. My daughter had complained to our mutual employer (in Chicago) that she had never flown in an airplane and that it was the only item on her bucket list. The next week, they offered to fly us out for a meeting and a lunch with them! I decided to take the entire family and make a nice little vacation out of it. We had a fantastic visit with my employers. After a short meeting, they took us to a great Greek restaurant where I tried several new foods. From there, we went to our hotel which was located in the heart of the city. We visited an architecture museum and learned a lot about the origins of the city. We also went to see The Bean, which is a chrome bean that is absolutely enormous and sits in the middle of a park. We went to the Navy Pier and had some great food. The highlight (or perhaps the lowlight) of the trip was our lunch where we ate traditional Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza was unreal- so thick and cheesy! Even though I was starving I could only eat a single slice. But just as we were eating, the city got hit with a tremendous thunderstorm. I have never encountered anything like it before. It was downright traumatizing though fortunately, it passed quickly. We wrapped up the short trip after another day of museum hopping and shopping. Although I could have spent another week in the city, I feel fortunate to have enjoyed the time I did with my family.","label":1}

{"text":"I recently took one of the best trips of my life. I went on vacation this summer to NYC. I have always wanted to travel to New York. I have had dreams of going there since I was a little kid. I majored in finance in college so to be able to see the biggest financial district in the world was incredible. I went on a tour of wall street and took a picture with the infamous bull. There are so many things to do in NYC and my best friend and I made the most of our time. We went on a ferry ride to go see the Statue of Liberty. We went and saw the memorial for the twin towers. One of my favorite moments was when we went to a rooftop bar and was hanging out with a perfect view of the sky-line. The only negative thing about NYC is the prices. It was like $15 for a cocktail, I knew it would be expensive there but it was crazy. Another plus about the city is that there is world-class dining pretty much everywhere you go. You could eat world-class dining or you could get a hot dog from a cart and either way the food was delicious. If it wasn't so expensive to live there I would definitely want to move, the city life is for me.","label":1}

{"text":"Dear Diary,I still can't believe it worked!  I haven't written here in a while because I've been preoccupied with my illness, but it seems like it's completely gone!  And it's all thanks to cheese! About 2 months ago I was suffering from chronic migraines.  I had one almost every day.  Then I read about a certain kind of fungus in a special kind of cheese that was reported to have medicinal effects.  This fungus supposedly could reduce--even eliminate--the occurrence of migraine headaches.  Luckily I love cheese.  And the only place that carried this strange cheese was Costco.  So I got a trial membership and bought pounds of the stuff.  I ate some everyday.  Actually, a lot.  Because it was delicious.  It seemed to work almost immediately.  The first week of eating the cheese daily I had only 2 short migraines.  The second through fourth week, one a week.  The fifth to eighth week I had only 2 migraines.  Now it's the ninth week and I haven't had one yet.  I may put on a little weight from eating so much cheese, but I'd rather be chubby than in agonizing pain from migraine headaches.","label":0}

{"text":"The past two months have seemed like a blur, but in the past two weeks, everything seemed to go in slow motion. Leading up to our graduation, every day was jam packed with things to do.  We were cramming for exams, touching up final papers, analyzing data for research projects. And that was just for school. We also had to find time to apply for jobs, so many jobs.  And of course we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t neglect each other. We went out every weekend.  We were finally all 21 and didn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t have to worry about fake ids, so we really took advantage of the full range of bar selections across the city.

We partied like we never had before, and we finally didn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t have to stress about waking on time the next day battling a hangover to get to class. After that, though, the dorms closed.  We all had to leave.   I went back to my family\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s house for a while, and the whole world seemed to stop.

{"text":"Two weeks ago I achieved my dream of finally attending the Boston Fan Expo. It was my first time and although I had read about the event, nothing could have prepared me for how much fun it was. One event in particular really stood out. There was a guy dressed in a professional level Hulk Buster Iron Man suit complete with lights and everything. He was surrounded by people admiring his costume and folks requesting selfies, me being one of them i'm not ashamed to admit. While I was standing there next to this giant Iron Man costume getting my selfie, a little girl, no more than 7 years old, stepped out from the perimeter of interested fans. She stepped forward with two foam Hulk fists on her hands, both toy fists nearly as big as she, and proclaimed \"HULK SMASH!\". The crowd bursted into laughter, as did I. As I stepped out of the way, the little girl pounced forward and began punching the Iron Man's leg with her foam fists. The man in the Iron Man outfit, being a good sport, decided to put on a show and duke it out with the little She Hulk. I was able to catch the action on my cell phone but of course the video was shaky due to my uncontrollable laughter. After the staged fight I stepped aside to reflect on the brawl I had witnessed and it got me to thinking. I started thinking about my own life and how this event is such a strong metaphor to my day to day. I am just one small person in a whole wide world, fighting against injustices, prejudice, and those telling me I won't ever achieve my dreams, yet this little girl so clearly showed that no matter your size or position in life, you can overcome the greatest of obstacles.

They told me that i should really think about adopting a animal because they felt it would be something that could bring a bit of happiness to my life. At first when they told me about it, I was a little bit hesitant to accept it but they said that I should at least come take a look and that they wouldn't pressure me about going through it. I agreed and went to the center on Saturday.  When I got there I was a a little nervous but excited at the same time. I took a look around and immediately noticed a little pup that caught my eye. I went over to where she was and asked the person who was assisting people with their questions about the little dog in front of me. She told me all about the puppy, the breed, gender and other bits of information and asked me if i was interested in taking her. I immediately said yes and was shone where to go to get everything prepared. I took care of all the necessary stuff and finally was able to my new little pouch home. I decided to name her maul because something about her personality just brought this name to me.  Well, it took very little time to hit it off and just after a month we've become inseparable. She's like my second shadow and is always there to meet me whenever I get home. It's been such a pleasant surprise to have her around, she truly has brought lots of joy and excitement into my life. It's to see how I've gotten along in life for so long without having such a nice little companion at my side. My world certainly has become a lot brighter with her around.

Writing about it this way makes the trip seem worse than it really was. Despite spending what seemed like an eternity cramped into a small space with the people who know how to get on your nerves better than anyone else, the experience was something that I'll always cherish. It's only been 5 months since we've come back and the memories of our time at Sea World are just as fresh and vivid as if we had only returned yesterday. I can still smell the different exhibits clearly. I've never been a fan of seeing animals in captivity, but I can't deny the impact of seeing an orca or dolphin up close. Even the penguin habitat took my breath away. It's hard to reconcile these feelings. My family seemed to enjoy it just as much as I did. Maybe more. They don't have the same reservations that I do about zoos and such. It was definitely something that my little brother won't ever forget. I think he's just old enough to really realize what's going on, and you could see on his face that the moment he pet the dolphin was magical.

{"text":"It was one incredibly stormy night, rare in the desert of Nevada where I live, all day it was overcast, it rained and it had also been extremely windy. I noted several times throughout the day how windy it was, how uncomfortable it was to be outside. I complained every time I went outside to have a cigarette how the weather was so nasty. I went out to have another cigarette and I saw the silhouette of a creature walking by. Seeing it excited me, as I recognized it was a cat. Naturally as an animal lover I crouched down and made click-y sounds as I asked the cat to come to me. \"You're okay, come here!\" I persisted this way for awhile. The cat, surprisingly, came over to me right away without getting too close. My partner then found canned chicken breast meat for me which I took back outside and put on a plate. I backed away and let the cat approach the food. It recognized it as food instantly and came forward. I eagerly approached the cat while it was eating and caused it to bolt. I was disappointed, having scared away the cat while it was eating. I decided to go back inside hoping the cat would return. Peaking through the blinds I saw a shadowy figure next to the plate of food. The cat had returned to eat. I refilled the food and went back inside, where I watched through the blinds.  Every time I opened to door to check the cat would run and hide under the car in the driveway, but it was clearly starved so I began to slowly move the plate closer to the front door, eventually moving it just inside the house and leaving the front door opened. I sat there waiting and the cat came to the door. It was such a small and skinny kitten. I convinced the cat to come in. A sound from inside the house that scared the cat away again. I repeated this process for several hours. My partner thought I had lost my mind and was imagining a cat being there with me until she saw it herself but finally the cat was in the house again, going for yet another plate of food. I closed the door and decided that we now have a cat.","label":1}

Could be due to my negative background but you still pop up in my mind, and no, i don't wanna chase you. I begged for change and i got it, but what all triggered these events? Lost love and confusion and cock blocked. I hate saying oh well, but all i can do is hope for the better. Changing what i do, pray that i die, hope to grow old and forget, keep what i remember and hope things move on. You hope at death, you'll forget, but you ask for a life that you know will have hardships. I do come to my own understanding that I'm not in my rightful place or surroundings, i belong traveling or around high energy people but i also have things holding me back from doing other things that i might enjoy. I take god into account and i also take life and something around it, but I'm ready to continue on but who knows. I get masked cause the body doesn't want to be in a draining depression all the time that i can't really help. Just free writing and experiencing anxieties,","label":1}

{"text":"I recently started a new job. It was the Friday of my first week around 2:00 in the morning when my wife woke me up and said the furnace isn't working. I ran down to the basement and found over a foot of water. I ran to the storage room and cut the power to the furnace. We saw through the patio door over two feet of water against the house. We had no pumps and no one was open yet to go buy one. We waited until morning and my wife ran to the hardware store to buy a pump and hoe while i got ready for work. I was on a 45 day probationary period and did not want to jeopardizes my new job. I felt awful going to work because my wife had to keep our son out of school to help pump water out. Thankfully she got a hold of our friend who was able to come over to help with another pump. By the time I got home from work, there was only about 2 inches of water left in the house and most of the yard was drained. I sent my wife and kids to stay at my parents for the night while I stayed and sucked up water with the shop-vac. I finally went to sleep sitting on the concrete step next to the fireplace around 1:00 AM. Despite the fact of insurance covered nothing, my wife and are are very grateful that we all lived, it is hard trying to fix up a home after we lost so much in the flood. I don't know if there is ever a good time for a flood, but this  really feels like horrible time to have one. The real kicker was the day after the flood was my birthday, and I got to wake up alone and cold.","label":1}

{"text":"Last month (July), I decided to throw my boyfriend a surprise birthday party. He was turning 30 (big deal) and when I asked him what he wanted, he kept saying either \"nothing\" or \"just to spend a quiet night at home.\" His low birthday expectations made me feel bad. We are on a serious debt payoff and have a very limited budget, so I know he was just trying to keep me from spending money. But you only turn 30 once! So I texted everyone he knows, from family, to friends, to see if people could come to a surprise birthday party at his favorite bar. This way, everyone pays for their own drinks, and it wouldn't cost us more than the price of a few beers. I found a date that worked for most people, and started planning away! It was fun, and it was also challenging trying to keep him from finding out. I had a few close calls, especially because his mom has a big mouth! The best part of the story is, when his mom heard what I was doing, she offered to fund the whole party! She gave the bartender her credit card, and all of the guests had free food and drinks to last the evening. This took so much stress off me, because it felt like a \"real\" party! He was so surprised and touched that everyone came. People drove in from as far as 2 hours away to see him, and I know he will never forget that birthday. It feels great to make someone else happy, and its an event that both he and I will never forget. He says it was his best birthday ever.","label":1}
{"text":"I was in a polyamarous relationship for nearly one year. I had another girl I was talking to that knew I was polyamarous. However, she had recently gone through a fair bit of trauma. So I wasn't pursuing things with her at the time. My girlfriend at the time was no longer coming around and I felt our relationship was near ended. I failed to try to address this and communicate with her. I started talking to a new girl a few days before my birthday, and we really clicked. Probably the strongest connection I've had with someone over just text messages in such a short amount of time. I was really feeling her. I told her when we first started talking that I was polyamarous and had other girls in my life. However once things got intense it became very clear that she was looking for a monogamous relationship. I wanted her so bad. My needs weren't being met by my girlfriend. The other girl, our conversations were good but, not nearly as intense. The night before my birthday I broke up with my girlfriend so that I could get to know the new girl. I broke my girlfriends heart. She cried. But she said she was proud of me for taking a risk and would be there for me. I also told the other girl what I had done and what I was pursuing. She immediately distanced herself from me and it seems I broke her heart too. I met the new girl a few days later and afterwards she stopped texting me completely and told me she wasn't interested. I threw away the two people who did love me for a stranger. I did it because I was lonely and I ended more alone than ever before.","label":1}
{"text":"Over about a week ago I went to go shopping. I went to the local appliance store that's near my home. After arriving at the store I looked around a little bit to see what they had. I went to buy a griddle and there was only one left. I reached to put the last one in my cart. There was another lady there that also wanted a griddle. She stole the griddle from my cart. I was really feeling that move from her so I took it right back. I didn't think things would get that serious over a griddle. After getting the griddle back I browsed around the store a little bit more. I did find a few more things that I ended up grabbing to use. Things that would compliment my new griddle. So finally I went to the cashier to check out. I was finally ready to leave the store. I accomplished what I had came to the store for. I am very happy but also a bit conflicted about the woman who tried to take my griddle.","label":0}

{"text":"We enjoyed thoroughly the entire event. It can be fun to get out of our comfort zone in a brand new activity. However, starting with one we already know and love will give. Make a quick list of the activities we are most comfortable with. Need some good ideas first. Take a look at our list of fun ways to meet new friends in a new city as well as ways to meet friends online. Personally I love the immersion dating nature of the show, not to mention how addictive it is to watch, and think we should all try it at some point. It is viscerally impossible not to like someone who genuinely smiles at you. This means smiling with our entire face, including our eyes. Try this as to greet friends and colleagues and observe their reaction. A smile will disarm defenses, boost your likability and increase the chances of a positive conversation before you say a word. Every time smile makes us start a good relationship. At last had a good partner. It\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s time to get super clear on what you love to do. Because when you pursue hobbies and activities you enjoy, you have a good chance of meeting people with similar interests. When you\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4re just starting to get to know someone, foster intimacy by talking about something deeper than the suck weather. Gradually disclose something meaningful about yourself and see if your new friend will do the same. While not everyone has the courage to do it, most of us know how to pursue a crush. Swipe right. Send flowers to their office. Invite them to a concert of a band you know they\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4ll love. Ask them to check yes or no under the question Will you go out with me? on lined paper. Apply similar tactics when pursuing a potential friend. For example, send the person an email asking them to lunch or coffee next week, and follow up afterward to say you had a good time and mention something specific that was funny or memorable.","label":0}
{"text":"It happened about a week and a half ago, I never knew I could be so open and that I could actually enjoy such a company. So my friends birthdays was definitely a highlight of the last month, I still have some good memories about it and I smile every time I do. This even showed me different sides of of and what I could be and in this sense it is significant and I would even say life changing.  Some of the other things that I remember is playing darts with people I never met before, we had fun and I felt connected just playing this simple game. I also remember meeting a cute girl, she a blond hair and her name was Anabel, I felt like I known her for ages for some reason, maybe it was the music that made me feel nostalgic but probably it was just a dejavu. The birthdays itself lasted for two days, since it stated on the weekend and my friend could afford an even longer holiday. There were a lot of fun thing to do and the food was amazing, my favorite dish was pizza of course, it was a real Italian pizza from some high end catering service. Also the fresh sashimi was great and tasty. The music was great and the DJ did a great job adjusting to our mood and taking guest requests into consideration. So this birthday was more of a concert than a typical home birthday I am used to and expected to experience.  There were some people whom I've know since I was a kid and it was a very pleasant meeting since we haven't seen each other for ages.  At midnight there was a fireworks show and not like a small fireworks that you can buy anywhere on Halloween but an actual commercial grade fireworks which were huge and loud like it was a major holiday or something, so I really enjoyed that part since you don't see that too often in a common weekend. Since it was a two day celebration and since my friend has a big house, most guests could just stay overnight in one of the bedrooms, it made us all feel even closer and the next morning I felt even more connected to the new people I have met the previous day as well as to my old childhood friends.  Overall it was one of the best birthday celebrations in my life and I really enjoyed it and will probably remember it for a long time if not till the rest of my life.  It was his 30th birthday and I guess that's why he decided to do on such a large scale and many of us felt grateful for that, especially since we knew what a good and kind person he was and this wasn't even necessary for us to start thinking of him even better.","label":0}

{"text":"Last month I ordered and received a new Dell PC desktop. I installed it and within an hour I had big red warning boxes popping up all over the screen saying my Windows 10 was compromised. There was a telephone number which I thought was microsoft so I called it. A guy with an Indian accent (naturally) answered and I told him my problem. Unfortunately, I could barely understand him so I asked to speak to an american-accented person. He hooked me up with another Indian person. By then, I was getting frustrated because I couldn't understand anybody but they seemed to understand what my problem was. So somebody else  came on online and gave me a quote for $225 to fix it and wanted my credit card number. At that point, I stopped and asked to make sure they were Microsoft but they never confirmed it in so many words (I thought about this afterwards). So I gave them my credit card number and they took over my computer and tried to fix the problem. The next day, I got the red error boxes again. I called them and wanted my money back and they said the charge was already gone through. I asked to speak to a manager, but nope, never got anybody else. I argued for a while with them and got nowhere. I hung up crying and called my bank and told them I was scammed. It took 2 days to get my money back from the bank. I can't believe this happened to me. I continually warn my friends about stuff like this. But now I know how scammers work. They scam you when you're vulnerable and have no other place to turn in the middle of your emotions! I swear, this will never happen to me again (I hope). I hope my bank is doing something about them - I got a letter afterwards explaining that it \"was\" a scamming company.","label":1}
{"text":"I went out with friends and family to a park that had just opened up in our area. I thought that was a very nice park personally because everything was set up good. It was in a good location as well and everyone around us just really seemed to be in a positive mood and good spirits and I appreciated that so much. I thought that it was something I could really get into during my time there. My family was also pleasantly surprised in how well everything was going since we usually never take time out like that as a family to spend quality time with each other. Everything from my point of view was going absolutely perfect and nothing could ruin the day. We took time to take fun and exciting photo's, go see different things throughout the park and also meet up with other family members who were out there and connect with them. Needless to say this to me was really just what I would call a perfect day personally. I even got to eat some cotton candy, which honestly I never had cotton candy before so I was actually more pumped than I probably should have been when I was eating it, I never realized how good it was. Definitely a highlight for me throughout the experience along with that my family took a boat ride. The boat ride was really nice and relaxing especially because we all just seemed to be in good spirits throughout the trip and the ride just made everything even better. I never knew that spending time with your family like that could create such a nice environment. It was just very nice, the energy and vibes everyone gave off and the laughter we had, you just couldn't top that. I was so happy with how everything turned out I was even suggesting that we do it again some day. I think my family actually agreed that we should give that at least one more shot.","label":0}

I started to asked them why they broke my window but they just wanted to fight me. Conti ued to try and talk to them until they started to surround me and then i started running. However I could not outrun them. The thugs caught me and started punching and kicking me until my neighbor came and yelled them away. I called the police and they arrived like 15 mins later.

After a short while we were having my mother come stay with us. Knowing my mother I know she likes this to be particular. She also really loves our home state and doesn't want to move from it. She's a New Englander through and through but feels that some of the major states, like Mass and NY are too busy for her. Anyway, she arrived the Friday and would be staying for a week. We spent the first day or two getting her settled in and showing my mom how we lived. How we liked to cook, how we used our little firepit outside our home and how much space our dog had to run around. She seemed to be quite happy staying with us. We went out one night for dinner and she loved the city so much we stayed out, getting drinks and bar hopping for hours. I think she really took too and enjoy the time being in a new city and state and being around different people. After the days rolled by and we spent our evenings together she got really involved. She cooked in our kitchen, made a meal for us, we drank lots of wine and watched movies on the couch. We just enjoyed the cool evenings of summer out on our patio, by the fire, cooking outside and having fun.

She was in labor and despite everything, she wasn't progressing like she should have been. We were there 15 hours before the doctor said she was going to need a c-section. I fought against it and so did Susan. We wanted a natural birth! The doctor urged more and we ended up allowing it.

{"text":"The new staff later reiterated this boss' unfair behaviors and other workplace retaliation against other workers.  The union subsequently discovered that this so-called boss was favoring certain employees over others during personnel evaluations.  The \"good ratings\" went to people who were this boss' friends.  Some workers would laugh at this boss' rotten sense (or attempt) at humor.  The jokes were so corny that it was impossible to find the random musings funny.  The boss' supervisors caught wind of the maltreatment of employees and eventually fired the boss.  How someone so incompetent could ever get promoted is beyond all comprehension.

{"text":"3 Months ago I made a huge life choice. After dropping out when I was younger, I finally decided to go back to college to finish my degree. Though the prospect in front of me seemed much harder than in the past. Now I had to work a job on top of going back to school and that seemed like a lot of hard work. I knew though that if I didn't go back to school, not only would I regret it, but I would be stuck where I was possibly forever. I started by making sure that my job would allow me to go back to school and thankfully they were happy to give me lighter workloads and flexibility. So I started planning my classes and getting ready to work hard. The first few weeks were tough even though I felt I was prepared. Too many times I didn't get enough sleep because I had to study and even had a few night classes. Even with flexible work schedules I still had problems with keeping up with my two responsibilities. However after the first month I felt like my mind and body had adjusted and I was working harder and better. I was also learning many new things in school and I felt I not only could do this, but thrive. All the work and studying made me realize I could do more than I thought I could. I did feel some shame that I didn't do this earlier, but the important thing was that I was doing it now. Hopefully I keep learning and growing as I continue on.","label":0}
{"text":"My depression recently grabbed hold of my life again. All summer I felt like a new woman. I was eating healthier, doing lots of fun things and feeling more like myself than I had in two years. My husband and closest friends noticed a change in me, so I knew it was real. Then suddenly, about 2 or 3 weeks ago, I had a really bad day. More awful than bad. I was sobbing and felt absolutely miserable. I told my husband I didn't want to be me anymore. I didn't want to be a wife or a mom, I wanted to be alone or dead. I've had quite a few scary days since that one breaking point and i realize now that I'm still not in the clear. I have good days, but i know that i can't fight this on my own. I have to find help. It's hard enough to talk to my family and friends about all the irrational feelings I'm having. I can't imagine talking to a complete stranger about how hurt and alone I feel inside. I know that I have way more support than a check of a lot of other people with this disorder but it truly makes you feel alone.","label":1}

Special because about three years into marriage you get really relaxed and comfortable. Sometimes the spark dwindles. Just being back where we said our vows was so special. Having dinner with couples of all ages and anniversary ranges was amazing. Plus the icing on the cake was my wife invited my brother that i had not seen in over 6 years.

I remember still hearing those words and felt so crappy about it. I wish I could go back and take the words back on what I said. Things were wrong between us. I couldn't look him in the eyes anymore. I felt so crappy and still remember those feelings. I would go and visit him and think how crappy I was to him. He would apologize for this and I would apologize and cry to him.

{"text":"Around six months ago, on my birthday, my friends surprised me by taking me on a trip to Philadelphia. This on its own is already a sweet thing for friends to do, but for me it was especially great. I've never liked celebrating my birthday, as on the years I have celebrated my birthday, bad things have happened that day. As a result, I've built up a kind of superstition around my birthday, and usually avoid going out. I'd told my friends that this year, as per usual, I planned on having a nice quiet day, go to the gym, treat myself to some nice food, maybe take the time to make a fun cocktail for myself or buy some expensive beer. They said it was fine, but they wanted to take my out to brunch, so I acquiesced, because I knew that they saw my simple birthdays as a sad thing, despite that not being my attitude towards them. I mostly agreed for their sake, so they wouldn't be worried about me. When I left the apartment that day, I thought we'd just be getting lunch and I'd have my quiet day. Instead, one of my friends was waiting outside with a rental car. They gave me a card and told me to go back in and pack a weekend's worth of clothes. I was floored, and obviously I went back inside to pack. I felt bad they were spending so much money on me when I knew I'd never be able to do the same for them, but since everything had already been paid for, I couldn't let it go to waste. To be entirely honest, there was a small part of me that wishes they hadn't done it, because it was the exact opposite of what I asked them to do: every year I ask to not receive gifts, partly because I myself am bad at giving gifts, and partly because I know I can't afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, and would feel bad about it. This, of course, was larger than any git I'd ever received, and larger than I could ever give, and to a certain degree, inside, it bothered me. But, I knew my friends weren't looking for repayment, and they were doing it out of kindness and a genuine care for me, so I shelved my pride and let myself have fun. We went to Philly and stayed at a hotel, swam in the pool, ate awesome food, and generally lazed around for the weekend, exploring the city and seeing the sights. I got to climb the stairs of the Philly Art Museum (like in one of my favorite movies, Rocky), I got to visit Reading Terminal, and we had amazing cheesecake. All in all, it was the best birthday I'd ever had, and I'm glad I got to spend it with my friends.","label":1}

Pleasure multiplies when there is a wedding in the family. I drew immense pleasure when the marriage ceremony of my cousin was held. It was performed on 23rd of the last month. There was a great excitement and joy among us to see the preparations for the wedding celebration in our family. Decorations were made on the day before the marriage ceremony. A shrine was prepared for the celebration. It was also decorated with paper flowers. The canopy above the shrine was made of colored cloths. Another big canopy was put up in the open ground in front of our house. An electrician with his four assistants decorated the closed space with a number of multi-colored electric lamps. My father and uncle stood at the gate to receive the guests. The marriage party arrived at-seven in the evening. First, the guests were served sweets and cold drinks. Many guests had brought different gifts for my cousin who was the bride. The marriage party members were very gentle. The groom was seated on a palanquin with thick garlands around his neck. The marriage ceremony was held after the reception. Many senior members including my parents and the parents of the groom were present at the time of the holy marriage on the shrine. The bride and the groom exchanged garlands and sacredly accepted each other as the partner of life. We cried when my cousin parted with us and went to her new house.","label":1}
{"text":"\"I attended college an hour and a half from home, and a few times during the semester my dad would pick me up on Fridays so I could come home and visit for the weekend. We were on the interstate driving home, when my dad starts to tell me a story about a time when he was in the Army. I forget the precise details, but it was basically about how he and some buddies went out on the town one evening and had a few drinks. ... The tale becomes a bit more serious and personal all of the sudden  like he's pouring his heart out to me. My dad then says that he and his friends ran into another group of guys and got into an argument. The fight supposedly turned physical, with my dad throwing some punches at one of these guys. Then my dad, in the most serious tone possible, tells me that he grabbed the guy and pushed him off a cliff. The guy died and my dad and his friends managed to cover up the whole sordid tale from the police \u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00ae this was the first time he'd ever admitted it to another living soul outside of that night. At this point, I'm horrified. Is my dad just confessing a murder to me? Was this mild-mannered man radically different when he was a 20-year-old kid? Do I tell my mom? Do I tell the police? Do I ask him to stop the car? Finally something in the story actually sunk in the part about 'pushing him off a cliff.' My dad was stationed in Louisiana when he was in the military and while I'd never been there, I was pretty sure there weren't that many cliffs. I finally said, ''Wait a minute, a cliff?' I'd been avoiding even looking at him since he made his 'confession,' but now that I looked over, he was about ready to explode. No longer able to hold it, he started laughing hysterically and kept saying, 'I can't believe you fell for it! You thought I killed a guy! April Fool's.","label":1}

But it was time for her to go to college, now, which meant that I'd be alone. I know it's kind of selfish of me to think of it that way, but I was really bummed. So I drove her down to her college, which is like ten hours away from where we live. The day we said good bye was... kind of disassociating, for me. I knew I should be sad but I didn't want to be, so I just kind of locked away all my feelings. I'd put together a video for her of all her favourite YouTube videos, so we watched that together before saying goodbye. She laughed and enjoyed it, and we had a good time. Then I drove her to a house where she was meeting some freshmen for lunch. I said goodbye and asked her if we could take a picture, and she teased me about taking a selfie (since I don't do that often). We look really good in the photo.

I have a lot of good memories of her, and I feel really guilty now that I did not stay in contact with her.  Who knows what she's like now?  I remember how into her I was for a few years though.  She's way too young to have to deal with this.  I wonder what happened to her in between then and now.  I'm not sure if I should reach out.  She probably would not want to hear from me after all this time.  She's so young too.  This makes me think about my own life a lot.

{"text":"Just a few weeks ago in early August, my great Aunt had her 100th birthday!  My close and immediate family is relatively small compared to most people.  I only have  two pairs of aunts and uncles with 6 total cousins (although 3 of them are married), and 5 little nieces\/nephews who are all under 8 years old that I see on a regular basis, even on holidays.  My father's side of the family is not in our lives, so gatherings are usually small and more personal and intimate.  So in other words, it's a tight knit family and my great Aunt is basically the \"matriarch\" of the family. The event was a simple party where we rented out a room for everyone in a nice Italian restaurant.  Almost everyone was there with the exception of my brother who was working and my cousin and his wife and kids who are currently living in DC.  There was also a few close family friends like my late Uncle's boyfriend as well to celebrate with us. What made the event\/party so special and memorable is not just that my Aunt is now 100, it's how in relatively good health she still is in!  Aside from not being able to drive anymore, she is still able to live on her own and take care of herself without needing any sort of assisted living.  She is still as sharp as ever mentally and is probably the most wholesome and nicest person that I have ever met!  One of the things that she did was dig up some really old photos of everyone from when they were kids and passed them around after dinner.  Even though I looked goofy younger, it was still a really touching moment because she had photos of everyone there from when they were kids.  She really has been through and seen a lot and it's incredible that she is still going strong.  I'm not usually a big fan of family gatherings since I do not have very much in common with most of my family, but this event was one I was really happy to be a part of.","label":1}

She don't tell any problem to me. pregnancy results is one of the main part of everybody life both of their happy to heard about the pregnancy results. Because the little baby is come to ours life. Its a precious gift for couples life, Some peoples don't get this precious gift. they are really very sad. Rest when you are tired the sickness can get worse. Avoid foods with lots of sugar or saturated fats like sweets, chocolate and red meat. Carbohydrates things like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta can be easier to eat when she feeling nauseous. If possible keep away from triggers food or smells that make she feel sick I can by elastic acupressure wristbands from most pharmacies. These bands have a plastic button that presses on the acupressure point on the wrist and it may help relieve the nausea. This can be challenging especially if she were not ready to tell your colleagues about her pregnancy. If she feel very ill its probably a good idea to tell her manager at work at work that she were pregnant but you don't have to. If she do decide to tell them about her pregnancy this is a good time to talk about any changes to her work that help. For example she might need easier access to a toilet. Or if smells from the kitchen or canteen are triggering her sickness maybe she could move some where else until she feel better. Try not to worry too much about people knowing she was pregnant its more important to look after herself. If she was vomiting several times a day or are not able to eat and drink at all without being sick she may be dehydrated which is why she feel so bad. If her sickness is really severe and she were struggling to control it she may need to go into hospital for treatment. she feel free to better suituation for her life time.","label":0}

I missed my old friends so much, but because of our conflicting schedules, its just too difficult for us to see each other often or talk to each other. Even though I try to call my friends they are just really busy, so I thought I could make some new friends and hopefully become close with them. Over the last 6 months I have been going out more to places where I think meeting friends would be easier. I went to the library, a cafe, a cute little brewery, and to the mall. It was pretty difficult at first to start conversations with strangers, but finally I found someone who I clicked with at the cafe. We both ordered the same coffee and had a common interests around the area. After we talked for a little bit I realized that we could actually be friends. I was able to exchange number with my new friends and we set up weekly coffee friend dates to continue to build our new friendship. Once I built this friendship I was able to actually find more time to call old friends and my new friend. I think dedicating myself to my friends more has helped me so much. I feel so much better about myself and have really enjoyed myself lately. I dont miss my friends as much as I used to and we have built new memories together. I think this was one the best decision I have come up with in the last year. I will continue to work on myself when it comes to my friends!","label":0}

{"text":"A few months back, I was going through a really hard time. I was suffering through depression, which was coming back hard. I had gone through depression before, and thought I beat it, but I guess not, because it was coming back quickly. I was experiencing weight gain. I was sleepy, and uninspired, and my best friend not only noticed, but reached out to me and made sure to keep latched onto me so that he could help see me through it. He started by just bringing me some freshly made (by him) soup on a cold day. I didn't ask. He just brought it over, knocked on the door, and said eat this. It meant the world to me. No one else has ever done something like that for me, especially without asking for anything in return. I hadn't been eating, too, so that was something that started me on the path to recovery. After that, he began inviting me over more to play video games and relax, or go out for physical activities like walks and runs, which helped me get more Vitamin D in my system and just to get some more endorphins via activity. Also more socializing by hanging out and getting out of the house. He never once judged me for it, and never once asked for anything in return. And now that I'm fully back to health, and lost the weight, and feeling like a million bucks, I still stay in that same level of contact with him, knowing that one day it may be my turn to return the favor. And I want to be there if and when that does happen, because I've learned about the value of true friendship.","label":1}
{"text":"The most recent memorable event was learning that my mom has a personality disorder call Narcissist Personality Disorder. It explained so much of my youth and adult life living with her and interacting with her. My siblings and I were never encouraged to be together, to congratulate each other, to help each other by her. We were only told of the negative things that each one had supposedly done and that we all had some type of grudge against each other. Therefore we all grew apart and did not trust each other. We were not a close family or even a fake family. We all basically just knew of each other. Learning that she has the disorder put a lot into perspective but does not allow for resolution or closure with her. Even with her diagnosis she does not admit anything. She still wants to be the \"pit stop\" among the children. Unfortunately, I see the same pattern in my siblings and myself.  At this point I cannot communicate with her. She has a great burden about me from my childhood that she has not yet acknowledged. So I am always-in her mind-trying to retaliate. She tells this to the family and they do not know which is truth and have chosen to believe her. I am leaving them and her alone as it will do no good until someone else is on the receiving end of the vitriol.","label":1}

I am usually a man with a plan and I formulated one quickly. You could barely see the house for how overgrown it had become. My first task was to clean up the front yard and give it some curb appeal. I mowed and trimmed the lawn and bushes and trimmed some of the tree branches the first weekend. It was then apparent that the front of the house, itself, needed some TLC. For my next and second weekend, it was going to be replacing a broken window pane and a ripped screen. All the windows needed washing and painting the trim would make a big difference. By the end of the second weekend, cars would slow down going by and I even had a few waves and appreciative nods. The next three weekend were spent inside the house, just do general cleaning, minor repairs, and clearing out a lot of junk and trash. The trash cans at the curb were full every week and I was making great progress. My last weekend, six altogether, was spent doing some finishing touches inside and out. I was standing back looking at all I had done and admiring the house and how it looked now, by comparison, when the neighbor, whom I have never met, stopped over to tell me how great it looked and how he appreciated it looking so much better. It gave me a really good feeling. I was glowing.","label":0}

One of the special location straight out of one of the horror movies, where they was a clinic next to graveyard where zombies popped up. In the clinic there was a psychopathy patient, doctor and staff going on with surgery. Of all the fan that visited to the location, the most memorable was this one experience with the group of three people than came in. All action were being recorded in cameras. The three fans came in through the entrance with fear, and coldness on their faces. They went to the surgical clinic room first where they witnessed the surgeon doing a surgery an accidentally cutting the eye then the patient would wake and kill all the staff and head towards the fans. Two of the fans went straight back trying to open the door back which obviously was closed, so they headed towards the next area frantically leaving their friend behind. As for the friend, he was basically glued to the ground no matter how much the actor tried to make him to move, shocked to the point of fainting while standing, while peeing himself. Even after everything was over the person still did not move until about 30 minutes. In the end the friends has to come back in to get him to go back outside to continue the event.","label":1}
{"text":"I recently went on a swimming trip with a group of friends. It was after a Sunday religious service we are all a part of on a hot summer day. We all arranged together how we would get there and where we were going. We drove in three separate cars. We arrived at an area of a river where there was a canal that had deep and slow moving water. It was a short walk to the area, and we had to climb down a rocky ledge to reach it. I decided to go in fast while the others were tentative because of the cold water. When getting in, I scraped my arm on the rock I was holding while lowering myself. It made me feel rather clumsy and then I started worrying about if it might get infected. I didn't make a big deal of it because I didn't want to ruin anyone else's time. We all swam for a little while, then gathered in a shallow area and just sat and talked for a while. At one point I decided to get up and explore some of the rocky area around the swimming hole. Being with the group was reminding me of times as a kid when I went swimming in these kinds of places with friends. It was making me sad that I don't do it that often anymore. So I felt that going of on my own and gathering my emotions would be best. I walked around on the rocks and looked at the trees of the forest behind it. Then I found a spot in the shade and laid down for the remainder of our time there. A friend yelled up to me that we were leaving so then we all climbed back up the ledge and got in the cars and left.","label":1}

{"text":"At the end of May 2019 myself and my family went on Vacation to the Smoky Mountains. It was the first time my children had ever been. We took them to DollyWood and my 8 year old daughter was finally able to ride the \"big rides\" at an amusement park. She was ecstatic! We also went to SplahCountry, which both of the kids thoroughly enjoyed. My sister and her family and my parents were also on the trip with us. We had a cabin for all of us that included an indoor pool, hot tub, game room, theater room, and a pool table. I have a nephew and 2 nieces, and all of the kids (including mine) shared a room with bunk beds. The kids had a blast. My son's favorite part was when we visited Goats on the Roof and he rode the Alpine Coaster. My daughter loved going to the Hatfield and McCoy Dinner Show. We sat in the Splash Zone and she even was called up on stage! She was very excited to be able to go up on stage. After the show we were able to purchase a copy of our show, so we will always have the memory of her being a part of it. I love being able to spend time with my family and see my children experience new things.","label":1}

{"text":"I recently visited Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore for the second time in my life. I truly enjoyed the sights there yet again. I went on a ten mile hike along the cliffs, beaches, and through the woods. Stopping to photograph the best scenes along the way. The weather was perfect, the potential for rain held off. And the sun eventually came out. It was spring time so the waterfalls and rivers were roaring. Unfortunately I was surprised to encounter trail conditions that were less than optimal. Though it had not rained recently, nor that day, there was much mud on sections of the trail. It was very mucky and I quickly made use of my spare pairs of socks I brought. This was likely because of recently snow melt despite it being late May. The Upper Peninsula of Michigan really is something else. In fact, I even saw some pockets of frozen hard snow still holding on in the shades of the cliffs that never get direct sunlight. Other than that, there were no setbacks and the adventure went just as I had hoped. I cannot wait to go there again some day. It really is a place that never disappoints.","label":1}

The first lighthouse was very big and red. It was shining from a few miles away. The second lighthouse was tiny and green. It only had a mile shining radiance. The third lighthouse was giant and blue. It could shine a light for ten miles. I had a fun time in the beaches. I got sand all over my shorts. It took forever to get the sand out. I went surfing but crashed. I got salt water in my mouth. That was nasty. The trip was very nice.","label":0}
{"text":"One month ago, I went to visit my niece. I love her so much, but her lack of faith concerns me. I really want her to understand the power of the gospel, to turn her heart over to the Lord. I am rarely able to do so because she shut downs as soon as I bring it up. God tells us we only need faith the size of a mustard seed to move mountains, so I clung to that. I have prayed for her constantly and tried to witness to her at any chance I got. During our last visit, we had a break through! This time, she was the one who brought it up first. She said it had been on her mind a lot since our previous visit. She wanted to know why I have been so persistent in trying to lead her to the Lord. This just opened the door wide open! Or I should say, God opened the door! A door my niece had locked up so tight for so long. I pulled out my bible and began to show her verses. I shared my personal testimony with her again. I shared things God has done for me, prayers I know He answered. That day was so special to me, my niece finally came to Christ!","label":0}
{"text":"I went to My best friend's son 1st birthday party a month ago! I had to travel back to my hometown to attend it, it was about an hour away. She made the party fox themed and It was very fun however I had bought a nice toy truck for him. I was the first to arrive there besides my bestfriend. So we had time to hang out with her son. After an hour or so The other guests started to arrive. Everyone began to eat and chat about . 2 hours in She brought out a smash cake for her son and put it on the floor. He had a blast with destroying it and eating it I believe watching him do that was the most memorable event. It was so funny and entertaining! After that the birthday presents were presented to him. He acted like he didn't have any interest in most of  them though!  But he did take an interest in a bouncy swing thing my friend put him in. I believe he trully loved it as he was giggling and bouncing about. Overall the party was really fun. Just before nightfall however is when I left.","label":1}

I\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4m still trying to process everything that happened that weekend and I wonder if I could have done anything differently.

{"text":"Going on a cruise is something I have wanted to do for a while. That vision became a reality when two months ago, my family brought me along for a cruise ride. Being a relative homebody, I had no prior experience with traveling. I didn't know what to do or what to pack. But, I eventually got it figured it out. On this cruise, I experienced so many different emotions that I couldn't imagine. I can imagine experiencing some breathtaking views, and that's exactly what I saw, but that wasn't all. The views were diverse and never boring. from jaw-dropping sunsets to a day where it seemed to rain harder sideways than all the way down. It took some time to get used to riding on the seas, but I got my sea legs under me pretty quick. Ultimately, this was a big learning experience for me. I wasn't expecting this journey to be so emotional. But I didn't like some of the things I saw. Some beaches were filled with garbage and dead sea life, and some areas were neglected even worse. What an experience that I won't ever forget.","label":0}
{"text":"When I handed in my project, I felt incredibly guilty.  Even if I wasn't found out, I would know forever what I did to earn my grade.  I pride myself on having integrity, and this was a black mark on my soul.  I ended up passing the college class with the project earning an A.  The footage was obscure enough not to be noticed as unoriginal and it wasn't something I had submitted in this class before.  When I am feeling good about myself, this memory keeps leaking back into my thoughts.  It won't let me fully rest and be at peace.  I'm not sure what to do to erase the negativity.  Maybe mentor someone who needs help passing a college course.  I'm thinking of signing up to volunteer and give some time back for free.  I think this will help me clear my conscience.  If nothing else, that project has taught me not to procrastinate anymore.  I get started on deadlines right away for fear of doing less than superior work.  So at least my work ethic has improved.  I learned a valuable lesson after all.","label":0}
{"text":"I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.","label":0}

{"text":"My Grandmother is 94 years old and has always been a very mentally healthy and independent person. Recently, however, her health has been failing and she is in and out of the hospital every few weeks for one thing or another. She is very weak and needs constant attention and help. My uncle and his family are living with her to help take care of her and give her the attention she needs. As a child, I would spend at least one week of every summer break staying at her house to visit and we both always looked forward to it. So, in early June I decided to do that again, thinking it may be my last chance to do spend that much time with my Grandmother and to also help give my uncle and his family a bit of a break from taking care of her. The day before I was to travel, I was given the news that my Grandmother was again in the hospital with pneumonia and that she wasn't \"like herself.\" I decided to visit anyway. When I got there, it was late, but I made my way into her room and she was asleep so I sat in a chair that was in the corner and slept until morning. In the morning, I said, \"Hey! Grandma!\"But while her eyes were open and she pivoted them towards me, they were distant. She mumbled something when I hugged her which I took to be recognition that she knew who I was and was glad to see me. Over the course of the next few days, she was very weak and completely out of it. But then, suddenly, she started to regain her faculties and started to be able to talk and think more clearly like how I had remembered her. On the last day I was there, she was so strong and cogent that in a totally impromptu moment during a conversation about how she should write a poem about her situation to help cope, she made up an entire poem in her head. She wasn't strong enough to write, so she had me transcribe it and it was amazing. She had returned to how I remembered her in mind and spirit and we were able to really have a nice last day together before I had left. She's had issues since then however and I don't think she's been as good as that day and so I'm pretty protective and thankful for that moment\/day I got to share with her.","label":1}

Because I am an adventurous person I decided to try it,which I did and in about an hour I had a bloated stomach and was belching. I could literally see my stomach getting bigger, and we were high climbing. I felt I had to use the ladies room, I ended up purging in the bushes. It was quite embarassing and fun at the same time but it was a night I will never forget. I took some of the fruit back home with me to show my mum. I vividly remember all the details like it was yesterday. For the very first time I rode an elephant and saw a 75 year old turtle. The local guide rubbed something on my stomach and in an instance I was normal again. The island was one of the best I have visited. The people are of Indian natives.

This all happens last night.  He claims someone drank his six pack of Shiner Bock out of the fridge.  Of course I did not do it.  Scott is saying the same thing.  He has no idea what happened to Mike's beer.  All I know is that I did not drink his damn beer.  I don't even like that brand anyway.  It is overrated.  So, we all start yelling.  I have no idea if Mike just forgot he drank his beer or if Scott really did take it.  Next thing I know, we are in a shoving match, and Mike actually punches me in the eye!  Of course the landlord does not give a damn as long as we pay the rent, and the police dont care either.  I cant break the lease, nor do I have enough money to go someplace else, find new roommates, and leave these two ass clowns with each other.  It is another two months on the lease and a race against time.  Hopefully, we can stay out of each others faces just long enough to go our separate ways.  You just cant be too careful when choosing roommates.  I might have to get a lock for the bedroom door and hope Mike remembers when he drinks his damn beer.  He gets real mean when he is drunk.  Of course, you dont figure this out until you have a signed a lease.  Scott is OK, but he is kind of just there.  There are a couple of people I know who might make good roommates when this is over.  They are not so much into beer like Mike is and can actually remember what they did last night.  I wish I could get a raise so it would not even be necessary to have roommates.","label":0}

Bloody face, possible broken ribs, legs were wrecked, and all airbags deployed. I did not trust myself to help the guy get out. I couldn't risk any chances of getting him out and paralyzing the kid.

It took me a while to go through my belongs and sort out what I had room to take with me and what I needed to part with. This was an emotional process in and of itself. I had lived in one place so long I had acquired many sentimental items and memories. To go through them all and decide what I had room to take with me was somewhat painful. Once I was through this process I packed up my moving van and headed out. The journey took about 12 hours and I finally in my new home. It was exciting to see new places, try new restaurants, meet new people. I feel that this process helped me learn more about myself and see things from a different perspective. I have learned from the diverse set of people in this metropolitan area and what their backgrounds are. I am now enrolled in a masters program and have a new job. Things are done differently here and cultural values are different than where I come from but I feel happy. I miss my family here but I plan to visit often and I hope they come to visit me as well. I think this process will move my career farther ahead than staying at home and I think if I am to return I will understand the way others do things. I am happy to have embarked on this new journey.","label":1}
{"text":"after messing up my ankle in football i thought I would never have full movement again. I was right about full movement but Im happy with what I got back. About 18 weeks ago my doctor said i was a candidate for a new procedure. This new technique restored 98% mobility in my ankle. There is only a 1 year recovery period and 1 month of no weight bearing probation. After that I have a bit of physical therapy and I should be good to go. It's crazy how fast life gets you down when your body fails. I am not 18 weeks in and feeling great. The journey has been long but so worth it. Not constantly being in pain is a big plus. I cant thank the doctors enough. My life is leaps and bounds above what I could expect. I really have a feeling of getting my life back on track. I love that i was able to participate and urge others to get this surgery. If you can take something to control your life do it. You will thank yourself for it.","label":0}

{"text":"About 5 months ago, it was a bright sunny day on the farm.  I walked into the stable to meet my new horse.  I was so excited to finally own a horse of my own.  I have wanted a horse my whole life.  I looked for quite some time before deciding to meet this horse that I felt was just perfect.  Only one thing, he was a giant! I have never seen a horse so tall in my life.  I didn't know how I would ever be able to ride him.  I knew I should have got a horse that was a bit more easy to ride, but I knew he was the one I wanted.  I took him home to let him settle in to the new stable.  After a day or so, I put the bridle on him.  I used a step stool to put the saddle on his back.  Now the challenge came as to how I would get on the horse to ride him.  I led him over to the wooden fence.  I climbed on the fence and hopped on.  I knew this was the start to a great relationship.","label":0}

She was throwing our boss a surprise birthday party and we didn't really want to go, but we thought our jobs would be in jeopardy if we didn't, so we went. Jennifer picked me up and we made the trip to our boss' house, where several other guests and co workers had already arrived. It was a huge house, bigger than either of us had ever seen. Jennifer mentioned when we pulled up that is was bigger than a decent walmart. We arrived, place our presents down, mingled with people we knew, and all of sudden, an hour into the party, we hear yelling. Our boss comes running down the stairs, asking someone to call the police. This sent everybody, including us into a panic. Apparently, someone had went into his study and stole some important business documents from the company. It was a very shocking and emotional event, because it lasted days after the party. Our co workers, and Jennifer and I were interrogated by our boss and police on the who and what of this theft. They eventually found out it was one of our guys in IT. We never knew why he stole the documents. He must have been looking for a way to get money from the company secretly. Nevertheless, it was a memorable party for everyone.","label":1}

{"text":"These events occurred between august and September 2019. My family moving away, in this event something I knew was going to happen eventually happened, I'm not a very social person and some of my only friends are my siblings, and on this day they moved away. This was a normal day like any other and I had both of my siblings moving away for college, we had a rather normal day watching tv, namely avatar the last airbender, we watched it like we always do on sunday evenings and it was honestly kind of depressing knowing it was the last time for years we would do it. The day was fast, we all talked and laughed and we cleaned up my sisters room together to get everything we wanted out of it before she left, I remember watching her walk up her stairs and go out the door, and get into her car and leave, it was a little heartbreaking. My brother just left, we had both cleaned his room too and he was ready to go, he had been getting in fights and arguing with my mom a lot, they were both ready for him to go. They had both prepared for college and were going to be leaving soon around 6pm, they were getting ready to go on with their lives, and to live their futures without me. I felt happy for them, I know they were both going to do great things, one was going to art school in new Jersey and the other was going to study Dance in Chicago, both prestigious places. I did feel great sadness though, they were two of my closest friends, two people who really understood me, and they were both leaving, and I had few other people to talk to. I tried to get them involved in everything before they went, I tried mini-golfing,movie watching, mystery shopping and just plane video games and board games, and we did have a blast, but it was depressing knowing they were still going to leave the very next week. I even got them involved in money making schemes like apps and survey programs, but they weren't interested, my best friends they may have been but they still didn't share all my interest. I also tried to get them involved in Overwatch and Minecraft and other online games so we could have things to do and they agreed to play but they unfortunately faded out of them, and they left our group. They still continued to chat every once and while and we watch shows streamed but they get farther and farther away chatting with their own groups and making new friends, I try but its hard to get them interested and they're growing more and more distant, and it hurts. I've purchased tickets to allow my brother to travel to come see me in Lincoln for thanksgiving and I'm excited, he's said he's ready to come back for a bit and come see the family. I'm excited and I'm ready to try to bond with him again and I'm excited to see how he is. My sister is coming back too, so I can't wait to see how she is and see if the events of the day she left have any effects on how our personality's have developed.","label":1}

{"text":"My brother visiting my family and I back in May was a memorable event as we took my three kids to a baseball game, which was my youngest daughter's first game.  She was very excited the entire trip to the game, which takes about two hours of driving.  She only slept part of the way despite having to wake up somewhat early on Sunday.  Once there, she held my hand the entire way through the parking lot, security and to our seats.  She spent the majority of the 7 innings of our stay watching the crowd, random events on the field and eating delicious ballpark food.  My two oldest had already been to baseball games, but were excited to be doing so with their uncle.  They spent the entire game also eating ballpark foods, but primarily talked to their uncle about everything they were seeing.  My brother and I got to see our favorite team play, despite losing.  We only see each other once or twice a year at this stage of our lives, so we value our time together.  We typically reminisce about our childhood and talk sports all day.  We both love the same teams as we grew up in the same area.  Our sports teams do not have a history of excellence, but we love them relentlessly nonetheless.  After the game, we headed home for another two hours.  We stopped about halfway to grab dinner at a location my kids really enjoy.  They all ended their long day with a shake and all three fell asleep before we reached home.  It was a memorable day with their uncle.","label":1}

We woke up in the morning, for the first day of our cruise. We headed to the port. At the port, we presented our tickets and boarded the ship. It was so beautiful. We settled into our cabins. We all met up on deck and explored the different areas. We had some food at the canteen. We had a drink at the bar. We also lounged on the deck, by the pool.

{"text":"Today, I woke up kinda sad. I had had a bad dream, where despite being across the country, and otherwise completely out of my life, Emma broke up with me a second time. It's really been draining me today, the depression. The lack of sleep from that pointless dream doesn't help, and neither does finding mold on my blueberry English muffin from the cafeteria. I ranted about it a bit to the workers, detailing how I told them about it last week. It really upset me, as mold is very much a dangerous thing to ingest. Finding the mold for the first time was just disconcerting, but finding it again less than a week later is just downright disgusting, how little do you have to care as a provider to possibly kill someone? Slowly, I feel more and more like my past regrets and overall despair are beginning to catch up to me, and beginning to tie me down. It really almost feels hellish, and a deep guilt builds up on top of me. Honestly, in relation to the mold event, it caused me to lash out a bit. I kinda wanted to start throwing the bread from the drawer onto the ground, calling out to all the people in the cafeteria to inform them. I think I may just do that if I see it again. I feel bad because it seems heavily childish. Given the amount I am spending for food service though, I don't see it as unreasonable. Hell, I'd do it at a restaurant even. It's not that I don't feel bad or lack empathy for the workers, but that sort of thing simply CANNOT fly.","label":1}

When the cake was brought out, everyone noticed the crazy candles and how the flame was quite big. The candles needed to be blown out quickly so they wouldn't burn the cake. All of them were melting quite fast. I think is was because they were so close together. The candles were luckily blown out in time. Nothing bad happened. Good food and friends.","label":0}
{"text":"I can't tell if I want to cry or scream more, I don't think I've ever cried from being angry before, but I am on the verge now. I'm sick. I just got back from being in the ER and I'm in my bed, I've locked the door and I just want to be alone. I have a blood disorder that makes me feel weak all the time. The idea of being sick, and feeling this way for the rest of my life makes me feel...well like I don't want to have to do that. I mean some days I can't get out of bed, my whole body hurts, and if I get a cut or scrape, I just bleed and bleed and it needs constant attention. That's why I was at the ER just now, I cut my finger cutting vegetables. A normal person would just get a band aid and move on, they would get to eat their salad and enjoy their night, but I had to go to the ER. I have to go to the ER so much for the dumbest stuff. It's just all so pointless, I'm so scared and angry. The doctors are only treating my symptoms and have no cure, my disease is just too rare, so I just have to shut up and deal with it. This visit, the doctor didn't even know anything about this disease, he was asking me about it, like I am the expert. Which I guess I am if I've lived with it for this long. 2 months ago I went to the ER because I collapsed at my school dance. I was so mortified. I can't do anything someone my age gets to do, I mean everyone was nice about it, but it ruined my night. It's like I want to do one fun thing, one little extra thing, and life shuts me down. I'm just so frustrated right now, I want to sleep, but I don't know if I can right now.","label":0}
{"text":"4 months ago my fiance proposed to me on a romantic getaway in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  It was everything I had ever imagined since being a little girl. Although I had no idea he was about to pop the question, my whole family already knew. In fact, they spent the past year and a half helping my fiance in preparing what they knew would be my dream proposal. My fiance, Alex, started  our day by ordering us room service for breakfast. My mother told him I loved homemade french toast with strawberries so that is what we got. After breakfast Alex took me to the shopping mall and told me to pick out a nice gown for the evening. At this point I admit, I was a tad bit suspicious but I was still clueless that all of my dreams were about to come true.  After shopping, Alex took me to get my nails done. By this point it was 4pm and I was really starting to wonder what he was up to.  When we arrived home he suggested I get ready for dinner. When I got out of the shower he was gone. But there were rose pedals and lit candles leading up to a note and flowers.  The note had an address on it, so I quickly but carefully got dressed and did my makeup. I rushed down to the parking lot and headed to the address Alex had given me. Upon arrival I noticed there were no cars in sight. I entered the  building and was immediately escorted by a kind gentleman over to Alex. We spent the entire night laughing and joking and just all out enjoying ourselves. After  we ate he finally popped the question.  Then my entire family came from the back of the restaurant to photograph us and cry with us. I still cannot believe he flew my family all the way out to Tennessee just for our proposal. And I cant believe my family had been helping him this whole time! I am truly blessed. Since the proposal he has never failed to amaze me. Today is our wedding day and I cant wait to see what surprises are in store.","label":0}
{"text":"My graduation date is approaching soon and I am getting more and more excited -I can't believe I am finally going to graduate! It has been a hard, last 6 months! I had to work extremely hard the last little while to keep my grades up, especially when my father passed away. I almost fell into a deep depression but with the help of my friends and family, I was able to pull out of it. The visit from my mother made all the difference in the world. I can see the strength, hope and courage she displays and her encouragement to me during this time -when she is hurting so much herself- really has helped me turn a corner in my grief. She has helped me understand that my father is not truly gone, he will always be here in our memories. So, I started today with a fresher, happier outlook, and I believe I received divine confirmation that everything will be ok, by several things that happened today. I was walking from my dorm to my first class and something caused me to look up. It was a beautiful day and not a cloud in the sky, but I plainly saw not one, but two rainbows! And the were just as clear as day! And that wasn't the end of it either -as today progressed, other things happened! I found seven pennies after my fifth class! My dad's birthday was the seventh of May! Then, after it got dark this evening, something caught my eye out the window. I looked and saw three shooting stars right in a row! Three was my dad's favorite number! Now I know, my dad is not really gone and he will be here by my side even though I can't see him, and everything is going to be alright. I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of my family next week for my graduation ceremony!","label":0}
{"text":"I think the best thing to quote here is when I met up with some internet friends.  I had been talking to them for many, many years, and we all decided it was finally time to plan a meetup.  We all scheduled to meet up at Disney due to the logistical nature of getting everyone together without needing to drive everywhere.  It was quite odd to realize that I had organized something so big (there were about 8 of us.).  It truly felt great, like we had been able to forget the problems we had with the world for a few days.  We had first went to Disney Springs, which is basically a sprawling row of shops.  We got some cigars, went to a bar, went bowling, and all around just had a truly great day.  The second day of the trip we went to Magic Kingdom, which is a really big theme park.  We basically cared more about hanging out than the actual destination, but we did have some good food, and some good fun.  Third day, unfortunately was time for all of us to go back.  We have begun planning future vacations together ever since, I feel it's a major event. It's gotten many conversations going and still provides us entertainment remembering the goofy things that happened.  I think it was a milestone in my life, as short as the trip was, it showed me that it's ok to meet people, it's ok to let people into your life.  I think everyone should take a chance and meet up with people they talk to online, so long as they're able to do it safely.  I think the biggest most important thing of it all is that life is too short to not do something fun.","label":1}

My husband, being the sweetheart that he is, decided to treat me to a spa day at the resort's spa. I was so excited, I had never had a hot stone massage before and was really looking forward to the experience. They always look so relaxing on the commercials and TV shows. Unfortunately the guy giving me the massage was just so...creepy. There's no other way to describe it he was just a creep. Constant comments on how great my body is and how he loves my long hair. Not to mention that I'm pretty sure there wasn't supposed to be rock repeatedly balanced on my butt (they never show that in commercials anyway). I wanted to speak up so badly but there's a large man standing over me with rocks in his hands, this doesn't exactly put me in a safe position. So I just layed there waiting for the whole mess to be over with. Safe to say this is the least relaxing massage I have ever gotten. I haven't told my husband yet, I don't want him to feel bad or get angry at the massage therapist or other hotel staff and do something stupid. Either way it's probably been too long now. I hope someone else deals with it and reports him.","label":0}
{"text":"Several months ago I woke up to my laptop being soaked from a heavy rainstorm due to it sitting below the chimney. This was a very heavy storm because normally the amount of water that leaks down onto the table is minuscule. This was the most amount of water I've ever seen and it just so happened this the night I left my laptop sitting underneath. I had just begun working in a new office area of my home and the day previous I had set my laptop next me under the chimney. If I had at least closed the lid I would have not lost use the laptop but it was left open and so the water went directly on the keyboard and into the computer. I did think briefly about moving the laptop but had worked a extra long day and was extremely tired and thus I fell asleep before I could get back up and secure the computer. The rain must have been extremely heavy because it was soaked. I was feeling quite upset with myself for the following week and am still a bit of upset about it . I needed this laptop and will soon be looking for a replacement. It had a back-lit keyboard and this is a feature that for some strange reason is not more common. I will soon begin looking on ebay for certified re-sellers that have a similar laptop for sale. Hopefully I can find a good one for around $100. This is usually how I buy the computers I use as its a good way to get a good computer from a reputable seller. I will probably see if I can find one cheap on auction from someone just wanting to sell their computer but most likely I will buy from a certified refurbisher. There is a list of certified refurbishers and I will start my search with this list as soon as I locate it again. My hope is to make the best of my loss and buy a good laptop that is better than the one I lost.","label":1}

{"text":"I had the worst thing happen to me a couple months ago. I like to go go-cart riding. It's really fun and relaxing and kind of thrilling to time a turn right. Well, I drove my go-cart over to the track which was a mistake but I don't have a car that it fits in. I had a couple nice rounds on the track and it was a really pretty day but then my gas line started to leak which was dumb because I just did a whole bunch of maintenance on my cart and should have caught if the line was bad. But the gas got everywhere! I got it all over my hands and my pants. I should have known to clean it up too after I reattached the line but I wasn't thinking and just started the cart back up. IT CAUGHT FIRE. It was so awful! I had to jump out of the cart so I didn't catch fire and run for the fire extinguisher. I managed to get it out okay and nothing on the track got damaged but my cart was ruined. My gas line was warped and important parts of the motor were completely melted. I think the owner of the track felt really bad for me because he agreed to store the cart until I decided what I wanted to do with it, try and repair it or just scrap it for parts. A new cart is so expensive though. I still don't know the answer to that one. But then I was kind of stuck. I didn't have my phone on me so I couldn't call someone for a ride and I certainly didn't have a go-cart to ride back home in. So I had to walk. I didn't even realize how far away the track was until I just had to huff it on foot. It's far! Like, at least five miles. It took me a whole hour to get home and I was exhausted. So I was out a go-cart and winded from the walk. I basically just played video games for the rest of the day to make myself feel better.","label":0}

She opened up and it was a great shock to me to hear that recently her family met with an accident and she lost her hubby and her kid. I had to give her lot of courage. It was an eye opener to me as I realized that man proposes and God disposes. It is the same lady who ditched me many years ago as she found someone more handsome and wealthier than me.  I really felt sorry after I heard her story. It was a bitter sweet feeling to say goodbye to my classmates that night.","label":1}

So i thought to myself ill give it a shot and maybe throw it up on social media for a few likes. so i wait for a rainy day. fast forward a few days later it starts raining. in my infinite genius i decide to record my foolishness, i may have also had a beer, or three. now its poring down raining and i'm out there shaking it like its going out of style wondering what will hit me first, sobriety or a cold. when the rain stops. a few minutes later i'm just looking up at the cloudy sky just kinda looking stunned when the clouds start swirling. so im just sitting there when i notice the wind start picking up and im just thinking no way. but then it REALLY started picking up and i dashed into my house. the wind lasted a good hour and absolutely wrecked my backyard. when i looked at the news later that today apparently a land hurricane has spontaneously formed over my house. i suppose what im trying to say diary is that ill try to use my newfound superpowers responsibly and that rain dances are no joke.","label":0}

{"text":"I live in New England, so I had to make travel plans to get there in time.  I got to Nashville 2 hours before the party and had to hurry to get checked into my hotel.  When I was all settled, I scurried about to shower, shave, and dress but had problems finding appropriate clothes.  Unfortunately, all I found were a pair of not-too-new jeans and a ratty t-shirt.  I had to wear them despite my reservations and prepared my apologies for when I got there.  I knew the name of the hotel and gave them to the cab driver when I got in.  He seemed to know where I was going and dropped me off at the Blue Nashville, which appeared to me at the time to be a nightclub.  I entered with much trepidation and went to the board to find the event.  It was there, Room 27, much to my distress so I went to the door and opened it hesitatingly.  To my surprise, there was a woman throwing cake all over the place with participants laughing and screaming with delight.  She was dressed only in a bikini bottom, although it really didn't matter as she covered with frosting.  I shoved my way through the crowd, which I estimated to be 120 people, looking for someone I know.  But after a certain amount of time, I found nothing but strangers.  I went to the men's room to clean off the cake residue so I could go back to the entrance and make sure I had the right room.  It was a good thing I was so inappropriately dressed.  When I looked cake-free, I consulted a person at the desk and asked her whose bachelor I was at.  She told me it was a person I never heard of.  Then I told her about the party I supposed to be at and she said, \"I think you're supposed to be at the Hotel Blue, not here\".","label":0}

{"text":"Perhaps the most memorable thing that has happened to me within the past month is the car accident I was in.  This accident devestated me, and it caused me to lose a good paying job, and I'm being sued by the other driver.  I was behind the lady, and I tried my best to hit the brakes, but it just would not slow down in time.  I'm not sure why, honestly, but I had only had the vehicle for two weeks, and I had noticed that it took a little more pressing on the petal than it did with my old vehicle.  I had even gotten out of my vehicle to make sure she was okay.  She would not even roll her window down for me.  I was coming home from work, and it was a forty minute drve from there to home.  It was sunny out, and the traffic was terrible, as it always wsa there at that time of the day.  I was shaking and trying not to cry, and even ended up giving the officers insurance information to my old vehicle because I was so nervous.  Even thinking about it right now is making my chest and head hurt. The police were nice, and understanding, thank goodness.  My vehicle was completely totalled somehow, and it barely made a dent in hers.  I was shocked to she her go out on a stretcher, though she looked and acted fine.  I'm sure it had something to do with her idea on suing me.  I had to call my sister to come and get me, and endure my wife crying when I called and told her.  I can honestly say this was one of the worst days of my life.  It caused me to lose a great job, and now I'm job hunting for a place close by as I stress over courts and lawyers.","label":1}
{"text":"Almost 6 months ago I began a journey that I didn't anticipate when my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. There was little warning and no outward signs that definitively pointed to any form of dementia at all. Oh, there was the occasional forgetfulness and a few times the month before her diagnosis where she called me one day to tell me something and then called again three days later to tell me the same thing again. But that only occurred the month prior. My aunt and I compared notes that month and she had experienced the same thing and that was the first clue that anything was wrong. My mother retired to Florida about 20 years ago, my aunt lives in Ohio and I live in Texas and we get to see each other maybe once a year. My mother is 80 so she doesn't do email or text and she doesn't have a smartphone, just the old style flip phone with the big numbers on it. But we all talk to each other almost every week, that is, we used to talk to each other each week until this past March when we saw the first signs. Then April rolled around and that's the month of my birthday and she always calls on that day but this year there was no call. I let it pass and didn't think much of it until my aunt called me towards the end of April when we both realized neither of us had spoken to her for the entire month. We call my brother went over there and found her in bed pretty much incoherent, the condo was a mess and she mumbled something about falling. He took her to the hospital to get her checked out and the doctor said there were no signs of a stroke but he saw bruising on her hip, knee and arm and noted that he thought she probably had taken a bad fall so she stayed in the hospital for a few days under observation. The doctor told them she needed a walker because her knee was not supporting her weight very well and also advised them to have her schedule an appointment with her primary physician because she probably needed a brain scan to rule out other causes of her confusion. It was 3 weeks before she was able to get the brain scan and the confirmed diagnosis at that point was Alzheimer's. She was in a long term care facility within a month and she started losing ground fast. She no longer recognized anyone and she couldn't use the phone at all anymore so no more phone calls. After 2 months she quit eating and they had to put her in hospice which is where she remains today. She gets more attention there and has recovered at least some of the body weight she lost because she simply didn't experience or recognize hunger any longer. We've all learned several hard lessons around this development. Alzheimer's now runs in the family and all 4 of us kids now have an increased chance of being diagnosed with it. I'm 64 and I have to think about the burden that puts on my kids and my wife. 5 months ago? It didn't even register on my list of possibilities but Alzheimer's just changed my life and I don't even have it. Yet.","label":1}
{"text":"About 4 months ago I lost my hero. In the middle of the night, I learned my aunt died in a car accident. My aunt was the most beautiful and strongest person I ever met. She was always the black sheep of the family. Never played by any one elses rules. She never cared what other people thought. When people judged her, she challenged them to think harder and be more critical. She changed my entire life really. She is the one that told me to question everything. That I can only know what I've experienced myself. That so many people in life just follow the person in front of them, and never really know what it is like to live. They don't even know themselves. She challenged me to become a more well rounded person. To think outside of myself and care about other people. She showed me that living a truly fulfilling life meant learning about myself and what I care about and then sharing that with the world. It was about helping other people.  She also taught me that dying is only scary if you were never living in the first place. So I know death was not scary for her. I will always love and admire her.","label":0}

{"text":"Last month, I flew from Hawaii to Tennessee to attend my little sisters wedding. I had been excited about this event all year and when the day came to head to the airport I was beyond ecstatic! I was going to get to see my Mom, both my younger sisters, and several other friends and family members I hadn't seen for years. I arrived in Nashville TN 6 days before the wedding so I could spend some quality time with my family and help out with the wedding. My Aunt was flying in from Utah whom I had not seen in 10 years and I was so excited to see her! I also had fun spending time with my sisters and my mom all week before the wedding. The day of the wedding came and boy could you feel the nerves in the air! I was a bridesmaid and also in charge of bringing my sisters dress and other supplies to the venue in the morning to get ready. I must say, I didn't know how stressful a wedding could be! There was so much to so and my sister had really bad nervousness. Anyways, all the bridesmaids got ready and helped my sister get ready and things were coming along nicely and it was now 2 hours before the wedding. Suddenly, my Mom came in the room saying there was a problem. It turns out the officiator was missing and no one could find him! A friends of the grooms was supposed to be officiating but no one could get a hold of him. Apparently he was known for being unreliable. My sister started panicking! My mom had an idea though. An old friend of the family was there and he could officiate weddings as well. I ran out to talk to him and he agreed to do it! Whew! Thank god! The wedding can go on! My sister looked absolutely stunning walking down the aisle and I felt so proud of her. The whole wedding was beautiful and there was not a dry eye in the house! I am so glad I was able to be part of my sisters special day and I miss everyone already.","label":1}

I have some knowledge in health and nutrition. I believe that high iron and low iodine levels in her food contributed to her problems. The most useful thing that she has done is utilize an infrared heat lamp. I use one personally and can say that it helped my health, even though I don't have cancer.

{"text":"While her friends seemed amicable I got a strange vibe from them.  Trying to be friendly I asked where in Africa they were going.  They gave me a strange look, said something in foreign language and left.  I paid it no mind and shut the door.  I continued to see my neighbor sporadically throughout the weeks and things were friendly.  I stopped my exercise routine and joined a gym.  My apartment is much to small for exercising anyway.  One day while in the elevator I saw my neighbor and asked how her friends' trip was.  She said they were still there but should be back soon.  The elevator door then opened and I stepped out and wished her good day.  Two weeks later there was a knock on my door.  It was my downstairs neighbor accompanied by her two friends from before.  I greeted them and asked if I was being too loud.  I had recently been cleaning and my music and horrible singing were a little loud.  They said no so I asked if they wanted to come in.  As they came in I noticed what looked to be a large box in the hall.  I asked what's in the box?  They replied \"you're new pet'  Confused I opened the box to find a cage with a beautiful parrot.","label":0}
{"text":"I was looking to buy my first home a little over a year ago. With my limited budget and the market being so flooded at the time, I was looking for a really long time. I put offers in on 11 different homes. In every case they accepted someone else's (probably higher) offer. It became very discouraging finding a home that I liked, or even some that I loved, that I wanted so badly and couldn't have because they chose a different offer. Then, about 4 months ago I came across this house, it was at the top of my budget and it was old, but it was perfect. It had everything that I needed and wanted. It checked all the boxes. I offered full price, all the money I had. I also wrote a letter to the owner expressing how much this home would mean to me. I truly envisioned myself in the home. They got back to me the next day and told me that they had picked ME over someone else's offer that was 10,000 dollars over asking. I was so touched and honored that they chose me over more money. It really felt like it was meant to be. It has been my favorite moment in my life that has meant something monumental.","label":1}

The best part about the whole day was how shocked and happy she was. I still remember it like it was yesterday. I truly believe it was my moms favorite birthday ever. All she wanted was to have her whole family around. I made sure to give her exactly what she wanted. I ended up not going back to my aunts house for the rest of summer and I stayed home with my parents. I love my family and they mean so much to me!

I explained to him how important this wedding was to everyone, he seemed to understand. That all changed the second we walked into the church for the ceremony. We sat towards the front and the procession started. As soon as my sister in law walked into view and started  coming down the aisle my son started screaming. Not a regular little cry, no he was screaming like he was being murdered. I quickly covered his mouth with my hand, but that only made it worse. He bit me, which caused me to scream out a very loud curse word. Everyone in the church stopped and stared at me. My son, acting like a possessed animal, kept screaming and crying. I glanced at the brides father, who was midway down the aisle with his daughter, and he was giving me the more horrifying look. He looked like he hated me more than anything he had ever hated. I quickly left the church with my son and calmed him down. We sat outside until the ceremony was over. Afterwards everyone walked out and just stared at us. The brides father and stepmother walked right past me without even returning my hello, I was humiliated.","label":0}

We could bring one person with us. Naturally, I decided to bring my boyfriend. I had never been to a baseball game before and this sounded like a fun thing to do, so I was really looking forward to it. My boyfriend and I sat close to the stadium, I had a hot dog in one hand a drink in another and I was chewing on the hot dog when suddenly, I noticed my face on a big screen above the stadium. Someone called my name. My boyfriend held my hand and led me to the courtyard, got down on one knee and as I held my breath and tried not to cry, he proposed to me while holding out the most precious, blue sapphire ring I'd ever seen. The entire experience felt surreal and he took my breath away at that moment. I had always seen these things happening to other people on TV, but never in a million years did I expect something this grand to happen to me, as much as I wanted it to. He mumbled a few romantic words and I could tell he was nervous. I was smiling. I was trying hard not to cry. I didn't want to ruin the moment for him. I heard him say he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. He called me his best friend. His true souls mate. It couldn't get any more romantic than that. then he popped the question. Naturally, I said yes! My co-workers cheered. I started crying as he slipped the ring on my finger. We kissed and I couldn't wait to tell my parents that I was engaged.","label":0}

{"text":"Daughter finally reached out to me, after a long period of not talking. A lot has happened over the years, and our relationship has been strained, but I think things are finally turning around. We've been spending a lot more time together, and talking fairly regularly. One of the areas of our relationship that I am working on improving is understanding her better. She used to complain that I didn't know much about her, or what she is into. Right before our big fight a few years ago, she complained that I've never bought her a custom gift, only thoughtless store-bought gifts. She didn't know this, but that day, I ordered a custom walking stick for her, since she loves hiking. I thought it would be perfect for her. Before the walking stick arrived though, she and I had a huge argument and she told me not to contact her. I couldn't bring myself to return the walking stick, so when it arrived, I kept it in its original box and kept it stored away, in case things ever worked out. A few months ago, I ran into her at a coffee shop and we talked for a few minutes. It went well, and we've been regularly texting and calling each other since then. We've visited each other a few times, and we both feel that the relationship is restored and back to normal. I went to her house for Christmas, and I decided to gift her with the walking stick.

He told me that my mom was in the hospital, not to worry, but she had a stroke. At first, I didn't realize the seriousness of the situation. I asked him if she was okay, he told me he didn't know. Over the course of the next few days, I found out my mom had had a serious stroke and was in intensive care. This was very difficult for me being so far away, knowing there was nothing I could do to help. A few days went by with me trying to find out as much as I can but getting very little information from my family. It turned out I had the same amount of information as them, which was very little. My mom underwent surgery and was placed under anesthetic until the doctors felt she had stabilized. They then announced that they were going to wake her up. None of realized that the process of waking her up would take two weeks, so this was a very tense time wondering if she was going to be okay once she was awake. When she eventually woke up she didn't remember much of anything or anyone. Since then she has been going through a lot of therapy, both physical and psychological. I have spoken to her a few times during her recovery, but she never seemed to completely be sure of who I was. Last week I called my mom to see how she was feeling. When she answered, I could immediately tell things were better as she immediately called me by my name. She knew exactly who I was and spoke to me like nothing had happened. This was amazing and very emotional. I was so happy she is finally on the road to being fully recovered from the stroke and that we can finally say she made it.","label":1}

Looking back, I wonder how I could have made it.  One time I finished a 60 page report that was due the next day. After taking a break before I was to proofread it, I went to my computer only to find my report gone!  I was frantically trying to find it over and over.  I called my parents to tell them what happened. They tried to console me. I felt better after the phone call and, after about an hour of feeling sorry for myself, I decided I better get to work rewriting the whole paper.  I was up all night rewriting it, but I did it.  I think the second time around was much better and I ended up getting an A. That was only one of many times when I felt like I couldn't take any more.  Another time I was doing a lab report.  I had been working the whole semester on a lab project.  Every day I collected data for the report.  Near the end of the semester I went to the lab to work on my project and wrap it up.  When I got there, somebody had broken in to the lab and completely ruined my project along with several other people's. Half the class was distraught over that incident and complained to each other. Fortunately our professor was kind enough to accept our unfinished data and notes.  We all received an A for our projects.  These are just two of the many obstacles I had to overcome.

When my friend, who is the singer in my band told me our Tom Petty tribute band would be booked to play here I was ecstatic. This was a dream come true for me. Tons of famous bands have played here and the stage and sound are the best of the best. When I first got to the venue, I was greeted by the staff who helped us haul all of our gear. We then sound checked and went upstairs to the green room to eat our dinner which was supplied to us. The green room had drinks, couches and snacks. It was incredible. I felt like I was a professional musician! After we all got dressed up to play, I was a bit nervous because I found out that this venue was almost a sell out show. Once we hit our first note, the light shined on all of us. I saw the joyous crowd and it made me especially happy. We totally rocked everyone's face off. We all took a bow and the fans screamed for us to do an encore. We came back on the stage, and played through one of our finest versions of American Girl. After this was done, we thanked the crowd and shook hand with the many people. When the show was done, I was tired but felt accomplished. It felt like I achieved something in life. This marked a major highlight of my musical career. All of the guys in my band were all proud of each other. When we got packed up, we celebrated the show by going out to eat.

We are talking about everyone from small mom and pop shops that cant afford the overhead of office space and health insurance to fortune 500 companies like Amazon and Apple. Those companies actually hire people to work from home. The larger the company the more requirements and prerequisites they likely have in place. Thats not necessarily a bad thing. Even though i may need a newer computer they may be offer health insurance and a full time schedule. There's always a trade off know that more scheduling freedom and flexibility and less management oversight may mean lesser pay or no benefits. Ways of making money online that may be overlooking when it come to ways of making money online our minds usually head straight to things like customer service for a company such as the company or blogging because that's what everybody is doing right. Well there are so many options in between that i may be overlooking. Some of the ideas we are talking about today will allow  me to use my knowledge interests and experience to make money. Because these are areas i know it may not take much to get myself set up for success. Our first overlooked opportunity is selling my knowledge, In this instance we are talking about creating a course or eBook that i can make available for purchasing online. Because of the automation available today I may be able to put in the work once when creating my packaged information and then enjoy those checks coming in for months or years to come. I love referral and affiliate marketing. It's where the vast majority of my income comes from these days. Even if i aren't a blogger i can get in on the action as well.","label":0}
{"text":"A month ago, I worked hard towards my goal. I wanted to be the best lemonade stand salesman in the town. It wasn't easy at first. I had to establish my lemonade stand empire. I started with a couple of stands. I got enough money to expand it to a few streets. A month later, I had stands on every street in the town. This was a very exciting event for me. I made a lot of money because of this. I hope to expand my empire throughout the state. I will celebrate this occasion with a trip to the restaurant. I got a hamburger with some beer. They were both yummy to eat and drink. I hope my success continues. I will help a lot of people drink.","label":0}
{"text":"My friend Hank died three years ago, and a co worker had gifted me a session with a medium after the funeral. I was grateful for the gift, but passed it off as something I wouldn't do because I don't really believe in psychics or fortune tellers. Three years went by and about three months ago, a friend from my gym was talking about a medium they went to and how much fun it was. I remembered that I had been gifted that session after Hank passed away and got to think about going myself. I scheduled it for the following Friday and was pretty skeptical on what would go on. I figured it would be in a poorly lit room and woman with a bandanna would come out and grab my hand and ask a lot of personal questions then give me a bunch of hokum about the spirit world and lights would flicker and so forth. I figured it would maybe be a fun story to tell at parties. So i get there and this nice young woman, Janice, greets me at the door. We exchange pleasantries and she leads me around the corner to a big red sofa and we both sit down on it and she asks me why I was there, so I told her about my friend Hank, dying three years ago and wondered if he could be contacted. She asked a couple of simple questions about how long ago we met and where then we just began to talk. Not about anything in particular just things. As the conversation went on something amazing happened. Janice grabbed hold of my hand and looked me straight in the eyes and told me about the first time Hank and I met back in high school, and asked if I remembered it. I was dumbfounded. How could she have known that. I told her I did and then she kept talking about things Hank and I did as teenagers and places we went and it was just like talking to Hank. I could not believe it. We started talking about things that he was going through right before he died and how he thought everything would be alright and that he would be watching me to make sure I was not doing anything wrong and things like that. I was amazed at how it all turned out. I thanked Janice and asked her how she does it and she says, she doesn't know, that \"it just happens\". It was incredible. I have recommended Janice to several people over the last three months just to see if they have the same experience I did, and they all have. I called my co-worker back and thanked her for gifting me that session, and I told her how much it meant to me. She said it was no problem and that she was glad she coul help me be comforted after Hank's death.","label":0}

{"text":"I recently went on vacation with my family. We went to Point Magu in Malibu to go camping for three days.  When we first arrived, we set up our tent and got our food ready for cooking.  Once our tent was set up, we laid out out sleeping bags.  We then started cooking our lunch for the day.  We started out fire pit and prepped our food. I then cooked hot dogs and french fries for my family.  We ate on the picnic table that was at our camp site.  The food was delicious and then we got ready to go to the beach.  We walked down to the beach and frolicked in the waves.  We then sat on the sand and soaked up the sun.  After the beach, we walked back to our camp site and started to prep for dinner. We had hamburgers and salad for dinner and made s'more for dessert.  We loved cooking over the fire pit, because we were connected with the outside world.  We went to sleep to the sounds of nature. When we woke up, we were completely refreshed and recharged.","label":1}

This was the first time I had been on the West Coast and the first time in a long time that I had been away by myself without anyone from my family with me. The weather was amazing and I saw a lot of great things. We went on two tours, a Hollywood tour and a WB Studios Tour. It was really cool to see the back lots of WB Studios and even get to step foot on the stage of the Ellen show. I also got to see some of my favorite shows' sets and also got to see famous people's houses on the other tour. I also had some of the best food while there. We went to a restaurant that was part of LA restaurant week and I wasn't even sure what I was ordering, even with the descriptions. We went to another restaurant that wouldn't allow you to take pictures on your cellphones. That was really different, but great because it made us all focus on each other instead of technology. We also went to the beach and to an art museum. The beach was a great experience and it was the most diverse part of the city I saw. That was my first time stepping foot in the Pacific Ocean. I will never forget this trip because it reminded me that I'm still a person outside of work and family. I get lost in the daily grind and forget how to enjoy life. This trip made me so happy and I don't think I'll ever forget it.","label":1}
{"text":"I recently gave birth to my second child. She was born a few days ago. She was induced at 39 weeks gestation. The induction went very well and I was pretty comfortable during the whole process. I got an epidural early on. I felt no pain until it was time to push. Even then, it wasn't that bad. I was nervous about pushing her out because I had problems with my first child. The same issue happened with my second so she had to be delivered with a vacuum. I was concerned I had to have a C-section but my doctor did a good job to make sure that didn't happen. The most memorable part of the experience is when the nurse held her up for me to see. I was surprised at how big she was since she was supposed to be very small. She handed her to me and she got to lay on my chest. She came out basically perfect with little bruising to her head but she sure cried a lot for the first half hour! It was a very tiring but good experience overall, even though I never want to give birth again. She is a good baby.","label":1}
{"text":"I entered myself in a big trail running race.  It was a marathon with over a mile of elevation gain and then another elevation of descent.  It took place on steep rugged mountain trails and over boulder fields.  I had never done that distance before and was a little nervous.  I had only done about 16 miles before at a single time.  I trained hard and smart for the event and did carb loading, etc.  I wasn't quite sure if I could do it, but I wanted to push my limits.  I started off taking my time and made good progress.  I was easily beating all the cut off times by hours.  About halfway through, while climbing up the toughest part of the race, my right leg went numb.  I literally couldn't move.  i couldn't drag it, pick it up or anything.  I took some salt tablets, got it moving again and kept going.  I  took extra care of my nutrition during the race of my rest and didn't have any problems after that.  I was running at the end and could have done more if I needed to.  I had a blast and easily beat the end cut off time by many hours!","label":1}

{"text":"A few months ago we went on vacation to Jamaica. It was a long awaited trip and a lot of planning had gone into it because of the international travel involved. There was much excitement at the prospect of being exposed to a new culture, meeting new people and of course, the exotic destination. I had always been fascinated by Jamaican music and food but there\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s something surreally authentic about experiencing these aspects directly in the native country and I just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t wait for the plane to land in Montego Bay... woo hoo! As we checked into the hotel set in the midst of Palm trees and shimmering water, Dad winked at my brother and me, and told us to meet him and mom at the pool. My brother and I exchanged a knowing glance- it was a family tradition. Every year we voted on our vacation destination and upon getting there we planned our activities for the stay. Our folks encouraged us to steer clear of the usual touristy stuff and come up with novel ways to interact with the locals..... andddd this time I already knew what I wanted to do. Last year, after the trip was finalized, as part of a school project we were asked to make a pen pal from across the globe, and no prizes for guessing, I chose Jamaica, and hard as it is to fathom, Aiesha has become my best friend. The bond that forged between us through the exchange of snail mail and this trip planned to her hometown seemed like the most wonderful of synchronicity! Everyone except for my brother was excited when I suggested we visit Aiesha at her school but it was my mom\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s idea to bring supplies to the local school which in retrospect turned out to be a lesson I will never forget. After the initial yawn-yawn, my brother got into it and we really enjoyed shopping for the school supplies. The visit to the local school, meeting Aiesha in person, distribution of the supplies directly to the students and their euphoria at receiving gifts from friends from another country is etched in my mind forever. Words truly cannot capture how happy I was, but it truly was an unforgettable trip!!! Aiesha and my friendship continues to deepen. It\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s been 4 months since I met her in Jamaica, and I am over the moon to learn that she and her family are planning a trip the US next year.

{"text":"On July 10th 2019 my husband and I opened a business. I remember how badly we wanted to open this business for years but never had the money. One day we met up with a friend who had they money to make it happen. We became business partners and were finally able to open our store. We were beyond excited to the point where we wanted to cry. Our business partner put in the funds and we supplied the product. We had so much inventory at our home that was enough to start this business. Opening day went extremely well. We had customers from all over town. We even had customers show up from other towns! We made a killing that day. We specialize in product for hobbyists. Our store give a place for kids to come in and enjoy video games as well as card games. I love waking up every day to go into work with my husband and continue to thrive with what we have accomplished. This store supports our family and everything we want. Sometimes keeping up with the store is a struggle, but we manage to give it our all and the store runs smoothly for the most part. We run card tournaments which attracts people from all over. Til this day we continue to give everything we have into this business. I am so happy to be able to give the people of this community a place where they can feel safe and comfortable somewhere to game freely without being judged by others.","label":1}

We tried to take my van but the blasted thing wouldn't start so that was out. We asked my Dad if we could take his truck but he needed it for work so that was out. We then remembered that my Mom had left her car while she was in Europe for the winter and I called her up. She told us not to take her car but we were out of options so we did anyway. We got about halfway to Florida before the clunker broke down! We were stuck on the side of the road for hours waiting for a tow truck to get there which wasn't fun. Even less fun was thinking we'd lost our puppy! In all the chaos we'd lost track of her and I was so sure she'd gotten out on the highway, but thankfully we were able to find her in the backseat later. She'd burrowed under a blanket and taken a nap, the silly thing! When the tow truck finally got there they towed us home. We were able to fix Mom's car before she got back from her trip so she never knew what had happened. She even commented about how it ran better now than when she'd left! I don't think we'll ever tell her what went wrong that week, but at least all's well that ends well.","label":0}
{"text":"We are now settled into our new country home after two weeks. It was a lot of work unpacking and taking care of the property but it was well worth it in the end. We now have a stall to put our horses and the meadows and vast scenery is beautiful. My wife's horse Bessie passed away earlier today so we buried her on the farm and had a funeral for her. Right now I am working on building chicken coops so we can get hens for eggs and I am planning on placing ducks in the pond out back so I can get duck eggs.  We plan on raising our own eggs and beef cattle so we can avoid paying high prices for groceries.  Everything is good despite a tragedy that occurred on the farm two weeks earlier in the pigpen.  My sister went out to the pigpen one night to feed the pigs.  I woke up in the morning and she was nowhere to be found. I went to the pigpen and found nothing but bones and a few teeth.  The pigs had eaten my sister.  I didn't want to deal with the police so I buried her bones in the meadow and had a memorial. This gave me an idea. I was tired of my wife running around and cheating on me with every man in town and I thought about killing her for awhile but I was worried about getting caught. If I killed her and fed her to the pigs they would eat her, bones and all and the police would never find out what happened to her. I am deciding on a day and time when to kill her and how I am going to kill her.  I will keep you updated next diary entry.","label":0}

So the main focus was on food and games. Not so much the formal aspects. They had so much food to choose from. It was quite entertaining the different choices they had. So much variety in foods. It probably went along with their multicultural families and life styles. Overall one of the best weddings I have every attended.","label":0}

We didn't even hear or see the bus. I pulled her closed and her foot hit a rock on the ground. She said \"ooomph\" and fell to one knee. As I grabbed her arm and pulled up her other foot slipped on some gravel and she went splay-footed next to the dirt strip that functioned as a sidewalk in that part of Florida. By now we each heard the bus, its engine loud as a jet, its brakes screeching in a panic stop. The bus' front tire ran over Lizzie's thighs, and a second later the double rear tires ran over her hip with a sickening crunch. I crouched by her head, and shouted for her to wake up. She did not. A growing pool of blood appeared under her legs. What happened after that was a blur. There were EMTs, an ambulance, and a ride to Southern General. Not being a blood relative, I was not allowed past the ICU doors. I later learned that her parents had come and taken her back to Merseyside. I wrote and I called, but I never heard back.","label":0}
{"text":"Dear Diary,A couple months ago I started something crazy. I saw an ad for some detox tea on the tv and decided to order it. It took a couple days to get here and I was really worried that I was just wasting my time and money. Still my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try it. It tasted awful, like seriously, the worst thing I have ever purposely drank. At first I really didn't see anything happening, other than excessive use of the bathroom. But after two or three days and around ten pound of bad stuff being removed from my body I began to believe it was actually working. It worked really well for like two weeks, and then it wasn't really doing anything anymore. This kind of disappointed me but I was determined to keep going, and keep getting my body healthier. So a month ago I started a different way, I started getting more sun, and eating more raw foods. I went on walks, and just tried to let my body detoxify as naturally as possible.  It helped a lot, After a week or so of that I began to lose weight and could feel myself becoming stronger. It has been a wild ride. From things I never thought about to becoming a crazy important part of my life. But I am happy that It has because I don't think i could be the person I am today without this journey.","label":0}

I still tried to interact with everyone and actively participate in everything. When we had group discussions, people always disagreed with every single thing that I mentioned. My girlfriend and I asked her sister to take some pictures of us with my phone. I looked at the pictures afterwards. All of the pictures she took were very bad pictures.

This was my first time meeting them and I had never done anything to upset or offend anyone. I did everything I could to positively engage these people.

I however, decided to be a responsible adult and drag my self out of bed. Bill was a sweet kid and I knew he really wanted his uncle to be there. To be honest I was pretty miserable for most of the ride. The car was definitely not helping my nausea but I eventually fell a sleep, which I'm sure was a relief to Dave. Thankfully I was feeling better when I woke up. When we arrived I was glad to see it seemed to be a small family gathering so not a bunch of screaming kids. There were some yard games  set up like darts and volleyball. Bill's dad had the grill set up and seemed to be cooking up a feast which was great cause I was starving now. Before long The whole family was playing a spirited game of darts, kids against adults of course. This was followed by a wonderful meal and cake of course. By evening things had quieted down and the kids and adults enjoyed making smores in the backyard. In the end I had a wonderful time and am glad I decided to go.","label":0}
{"text":"It was the end of March, the 29th to be exact. It should have been an extremely joyous and happy day for me, but because of an unfortunate accident it was more memorable for something else. I was driving home from the attorney's office with fresh keys in my pocket after I just signed the papers to close on my new home. The weather was beautiful and I was on cloud nine as I drove down the interstate to celebrate with my wife and kids before soccer practice. I decided to take an express lane to get home faster and was exiting back on to the normal roadway when everything seemed fine. I checked my mirrors and looked back to my right, as I was merging from the left, and saw plenty of space to merge. As I was almost completely merged a felt a soft (extremely soft) bump and then a second or so passed and I heard the blast of my horn. It was such slight impact that it took me a moment to realize that I actually was just in an accident. I looked back in mirror and waved to the driver that I was going to get over to the right hand shoulder and pull over. As I eventually pulled over the driver of the car got out and started yelling and then the passenger of the car got out and was even more mad. I got out to assess my car and theirs and I see that they are already calling the police. I thought to myself that this was no big deal as my car barely had a scratch on it and theirs only had minor damage. As we waited for the police I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back, but because I was the one merging I was going to be at fault.  I thought more and more about it and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room. As things progressed, I was ticketed and I talked to the other driver and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost. She said that they were alright and were okay and then they left. Later on, I found out that they were trying to get a large settlement from my insurance company and hired a lawyer and were claiming injury. It hit me at that point, that I think they were trying to pull an insurance scam. They knew that I would be at fault for merging and they could get money out of the situation. Now when I think of that day, I can only think of the accident and how I was taken advantage of and I don't really feel happy about closing on my new house.","label":1}

I'm really happy about being able to bring my pet along, and I know he's excited for the new home as well. I'm also hopeful that we can find a really good deal on some couches, so we can spend a bit more on the t.v. we want to buy for our house. I'm just really excited to be taking this step with my boyfriend, and I hope he feels the same way. There might be some struggles along the way, as we find out what it means to own our own place, but I'm sure that we'll manage as long as we are in this together. We've already got a few things gifted to us by his parents, they've given us the basic forks, plates and some things for the bedroom as well. We'll be taking his bed with us, so we won't have to worry about sleeping on the floor when we first move in. The most surprising thing about us getting our own little place was that his aunt had bought us an entire bathroom set. I hadn't been expecting it, due to her living in Chicago, but I thought that was really sweet and kind of her to do. We both thanked her, and made sure that we'd do our best to take care of the things that came in the set. I'm just overly excited about being able to finally have my own place, since I had originally been living with my parent still, so had my boyfriend. This is a really big step for us towards adulthood and I'm just excited to get it all started. I know there are going to be challenges along the way, but I personally believe that in the end, we're going to make it work and have a place to call home!","label":1}

Families are devastated by alcoholism. No one dies from smoking pot. People do not get violent from smoking pot but they do from drinking alcohol. If marijuana was legalized, perhaps the consumption of alcohol would decrease. People addicted to pain pills could also use marijuana for relief of pain.

{"text":"Three months ago my husband went to the doctor for just his annual checkup. While there, I indicated that he was having issues breathing, that he got out of breath quickly. The doctor hesitated but decided to do a breathing test. This test involved walking on a treadmill while his breathing was being monitored by machines. We thought, ok, not a real big problem. In the days leading up to the testing we decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. We started cleaning our carpets but were not finished the day of the test. While doing the test the nurses were alarmed, canceled the remainder of the test and told us that my husband was NOT to do any more carpet cleaning or anything to exert himself. This caused alarms to us. We went to see the heart doctor who directed us to a heart surgeon. She immediately admitted my husband to the hospital for a quadruple heart bypass. This was a critical day for both of us, not knowing his chances of making it through the surgery or how life would be after surgery. I had to learn how to do the outdoor tasks that usually fall on the man of the house. I learned how to drive the tractor to cut the grass, and the worst of all was learning how to operate the snowblower to clear the sidewalks and driveways. I had to do all household activities for 6 months, however in the end I still had the love of my life and we continue to enjoy life together. Now we take long walks when we want, take naps when we feel we must and enjoy an occasional pizza together.","label":1}

{"text":"The most memorable and enjoyable experience I can think back to, happened to me a few months ago when I got to see my favorite band perform live. This happened at a previous job I worked for a few months back. At the time I was ushering at a convention center. My responsibility was to greet the people and direct them to their seats for the event. on that night my favorite band was going to be performing. At the time I didn't know they were going to play because I did not thoroughly read about the event prior. They were the last to play onstage. After they had played a few sets it was time for their last song. Before the last song started one of my managers  told me that the lead singer was going to walk by the upper stadium were I was at during the start of the song. This was exciting for me and I almost could not breathe because I really loved the lead singer and was very fond of him. Just as stated before he did walk by were I was as he song the last song. I was so close to him that I patted him on his side to get his attention. He didn't hear or see me because it was so loud in their and security guards were pushing people away from him. Even though I couldn't talk to him I was content with seeing him up close and touching him. After that night I moved on to work some were else. It was the perfect way to end my last night at that job though","label":1}
{"text":"My father passed away two months ago.  He was 70 years old.  He was diagnosed with lung cancer only seven months ago.  His first symptoms were difficulties in memory and reading.  An MRI showed a tumor in his brain.  Further investigation revealed that the cancer had originated in his lungs.  My dad and I were extremely close, and this news affected me deeply.  We were both shocked by it all, and both had trouble coming to grips with it.  I spent just about every day with him after work, helping him get to appointments and running errands for him.  When it became clear that he was terminal, him and I spent the rest of his day settling his affairs and preparing for the end.  Looking back on what happened, what really sticks out the most was how quickly everything had happened.  Before his diagnosis, Dad was in excellent health.  To see him go from that to death in 7 months will always be a shock to me.  It gave me my first real brush with mortality.  I have, since then, given maybe too much thought to the impermanence of life.","label":1}

It also took a while for him to get ready for this event, but that's alright. I just wanted him to enjoy himself. It's hard seeing him grow up and knowing he might grow out of something at any moment. That being said, the experience was great. He got to say a variety of animals. He loved the pandas, fishes, and he had a great experience with a lion. The lion was surprisingly docile, and let my son pet him on the nose. The purr the lion made could start earthquakes, I tell you what. We spent a couple of hours there and really enjoyed ourselves. Afterwards, we made the trip home. The fun wasn't over, as he still had presents to open. He opened the presents with great velocity and truly appreciated each one. I think I'm raising him right.","label":0}

{"text":"We gather in the car on the way to get some sushi by a nearby parlor none of us had been to. Sushi was not particularly my families favorite food, but I thought the experience would be neat, and the place was very local. We enter the parlor and were greeted by smiling hosts that took us to our seats right away. I really did not know all too much about sushi other then what it was. By this I mean that placing my order may be a little difficult because I dont know the difference between the items on the menu really. We all made our orders, and ended up getting a family platter that allows us to try tons of different types of the sushi. My parents and brothers look excited and happy, although my mom is a little fidgety with eating the sushi. My mom has always been a little squemish when it came to unfamiliar food, however she seemed to be a good sport today. We all laugh and have a good time as our food arrive, and we all seem to really enjoy it. My mom was surprised with how much she liked the sushi in general, and raved about wanting to get it more often. My little brother accidentally ate some of the wassabi sauce by itself to taste it, which provided a great laugh for all of us at the table. Following the restaurant, we all head home to enjoy some cake my mom had made that night and just hang and play games. It was not often the family would be all together, so we tried to take advantage of all the time we had together. We played some new boardgames that my brother brought, as he normally enjoys finding board games for us to try. This one was named Qatan or something like that, and was all about gaining grops and selling them for profit to get the most homes. Days like this really remind me of all the good times our family has had together, and makes you want to set more time aside to spend time with one another. At the same time, there is a medium though because spending too much time can make you a little testy because thats how family gets.","label":0}

{"text":"Two years ago I graduated from a prestigious school with a master degree in which I worked very hard for several years on. It was very expensive as well and I see a long road ahead as I try to work and pay off student debt. The school was a place where I had wanted to go for several years before graduating high school but wasn't able to secure a scholarship to pay for it. I struggled a lot with myself and the school to try and pay my way through it. It was a difficult time and I was very unhappy with the way things were going. At the time of graduation, I decided not to walk with the rest of my class on that day because I was so upset thinking of the future and what was to come next. As I think back now, I regret that decision very much. I should have walked with the people I had grown close to. The students, the teachers and for everyone who supported me during that time. I am sure that I let a lot of people down because of it. Now that I'm out of college, I wish I would go back and do it again, just to walk with them and celebrate this achievement which I spent so much time and money doing. You can only do it once, and I should have done it. I should have looked past my emotions at the time and thought about the future and realized I would not feel this way forever. It was a temporary state and I would regret it later in life. It's unfortunate that this happened, but I will have to live with it forever now. I would give anything to go back and change it.","label":0}
{"text":"It was my 30th birthday and I didn't really think much of it. I woke up at about 9:30 AM in the morning and my mother handed me a birthday card. On the card it said, \"I have an amazing son... who knows who he is and what he wants. Tells it like it is and lives his own truth.\" The guitar had a bright red guitar logo on it. I felt that this meant a lot to me since I love rock and playing guitar. My mother put a lot of thought into this card and knew exactly what I wanted. It made me feel very motivated. I felt very appreciative of this card, following that she took me to the movies to go see Godzilla. I felt very appreciative of this, because Godzilla is one of my favorite franchises. She even bought me popcorn. Though, initially the popcorn was stale a fact I bought up to her she suggested that I go and get another bowl. I went to get a fresh bowl of popcorn made and it was delicious. It was warm and buttery. After we finished watching the movie I thought that it was alright and decent. My mother liked it a little more than I did surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters, there isn't much human characters can do and also a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat. A lot of the characters in the movie felt pointless and unnecessary. Following that she took me to go and get some Indian food. I really appreciated that, because Indian cuisine is my favorite. The food that day was particularly delicious. I had a short conversation with some people next to me, but I don't really think my intrusion into their conversation was all that welcomed. It was a fun day all and all and I had a lot of appreciation for my mother and her taking me to the movies.","label":1}

{"text":"I bought my wedding dress two months ago! It was an amazing experience! When I was planning my wedding dress shopping trip, I invited my mom, sister, maid of honor, future mother-in-law, and future sister-in-law, because I wanted them to share in the experience. We made two appointments in a town near my home town for a Saturday, but there was one store that I wanted to visit that was about an hour away. So, my mom and I made a secret plan to visit the far away store, just to be sure that my dress wasn't there, but I thought that since it would be my first time trying on dresses, there would be no way that I would find my dress without the rest of my party! Well, I was wrong! My mom and I walked into the bridal salon, and while we were waiting for the bridal consultant, we both locked eyes on a dress at the same time. We decided that I should try on that dress first, because it was absolutely beautiful. When our bridal consultant came up to us, we picked a few other dresses that matched my style, but I tried on the original dress first. Even though it was beautiful, I wasn't sure if it was the one for me, so I kept trying on more. After about a dozen dresses, I tried on another dress that was exactly what I had pictured myself getting married in...but I couldn't stop thinking about the first dress! So, I tried on the first dress again, this time with a veil, and my mom and I both knew--that was the one. The best part of the story comes next, though! At this bridal salon, they allow the first bride who purchases a dress to give it a name (like a human name), and my dress had never been purchased before. So, I got to name my dress after my maternal grandmother, who died fourteen years ago, and who my mom and I miss very much. We both cried! Then, the next day, the rest of my initial wedding dress crew came back with me so they could see the dress. We all cried and drank champagne, and it was one the best experiences I've ever had!","label":1}

We had no clue he was sick until one night he just fell out in the floor and released his bladder, unresponsive, weak, stiff as a board, eyes open, looked like he had died. It was very scary not knowing what to do, do you move him? do you leave him alone? does he need CPR? I was so scared and I am a mother of 2 grown sons. He continued to have 2 more of these episodes throughout the night, morning could not get here fast enough. We took our little man to the vet, he was scared and unsure, like always. We found out our babies heart murmur has gotten worse, this is not good. Basically his heart gives out and he passes out. He is now on a heart medication, twice daily. And he actually takes his medication like a good boy. But it worries me, how long will he have? When will he do this again? What if this happens and I'm not home to help him.

Everyone was very happy and I could only see Teresa from human resources. She had taken A holiday in southern Greece and really looked more beautiful than normal. I wondered if she is admiring her beauty or was admiring the fact that she looked so relaxed and fresh and at that time I asked her to tell me about her vacation when that moment a companion arrived and fell and the champagne that he brought in the cup went to give the beautiful dress that the young woman brought. Immediately went to clean and I continued admiring its beauty in the distance. The next day some friends arrived with a money problem that to be honest do not understand something about bowling and I really ignored them, all the time I spent thinking about Teresa and her beautiful wine-colored dress. The truth is that I spent the next day thinking about her, what she would be doing where she was going and every time she had a chance. I talked to her but one day. unfortunately, she left work. got a better job offer and without hesitation she left. So now I only think if I will see her again one day. I hope it's like that.

{"text":"It started out as a normal, everyday morning, I was walking my dog around the apartment complex where I lived and encountered one of my good friends.  He walked with us for a bit, talking about life in general, when we spied a little creature slinking along the sidewalk.  It was curious about us, and showed absolutely no fear of my dog or us.  My friend crouched down and called to it, and it ran right to him and allowed him to pick it up.  It was a young ferret!!  The poor little guy was fully tame and wanted human attention.  We figured that it must be lost, and I agreed to take it in while we asked around and checked the papers and social media to find it's owner.  Later that day, I found a small cage and leftover ferret food in a dumpster near where we found him.  I put two and two together and realized that someone had actually thrown him away.  Such cruelty and careless attitude!  I decided right then that even if we found the \"true\" owner, I wasn't returning him.  Upon further investigation, we found that a person had been recently evicted, and had not only thrown the ferret in the garbage, but had also abandoned their dog in their now vacant apartment.  I now had to make a choice - do I want to keep and raise this adorable little weasel, or hand him over to animal control to be adopted out.  The decision was quite easy for me.  Although I knew nothing about ferrets, he was so cute and loving (as well as a little terrorist to my dog), I would research everything I knew so that this little guy would have the best life possible.  While caring for him has added a lot of additional responsibility, time and financial investment, he's just about the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.  He's now a full-fledged member of our family, and even my aging dog has accepted him, and even goes so far as to \"protect\" him when we play \"too rough\".  Looking back, the day we found him was the best day so far this year.","label":1}

My Mom isn't much for being the center of attention or professing her emotions beyond what is necessary. In fact, it is quite possible I've seen my Dad cry more than I have seen her cry. That is saying a lot! At her birthday party, she was clearly very surprised when she arrived. There were easily a hundred people in attendance. The greatest moment of all, though, was when her eyes finally landed on me. She started CRYING and then she started laughing and then she cried some more. Her legs just about gave out from underneath her. To make things even better, it was all caught on tape! I will never, for the rest of my life, forget that moment.

A few weeks later I went to my naturalization ceremony. It was a very emotional day and I teared up several times. The ceremony itself was really unorganized and I was very stressed that morning. We arrived with plenty of time to spare but the parking lot at the venue was full so we had to park elsewhere. Then the line for security was insane. It was like going through customs at an airport! Then I simply followed the people ahead of me into another room because there was no signage or instruction about where to go! It was actually horrible. I am a control freak (I acknowledge that) and I felt incredibly out of control. By the time I got to my seat I was sweaty and stressed out. Once the ceremony started, that faded away. There were 1500 people there to pledge their allegiance to the US along with me and it was such a sight to see. During the ceremony the judge talked about becoming an 'us' instead of a 'them', and that now I was responsible for helping shape the future of our country.

My husband was running late and texted me that he would be there in about ten minutes. We waited for a while, listening to the radio in the car, and everything was fine for about seven or eight minutes. Then I heard a loud engine in the distance. My son heard it too, and commented on it. After a while the noise grew louder and eventually the car was close enough that I could see it coming. The car was speeding and veering around, so I quickly realized the driver was drunk. My son and I sat in silence, hoping that this reckless driver would pass by without causing any problems for us. Unfortunately that was not the case. Just as the car was passing us, it started spinning wildly. This happened so suddenly that neither of us had time to react. I had parked the car next to a light pole because I thought it would make it easier for my husband to find us in a bright spot. That light pole may have saved our lives, because the spinning car hit the pole and stopped instead of hitting our car. My son and I were both so shocked that we didn't say anything for a while. Eventually we got out of the car to check on the driver, who also got lucky and only had a few minor injuries. My husband arrived just as this was happening, and ran to the scene of the accident. He was relieved to find out that we were okay, and I was glad that he hadn't arrived a bit earlier when he could have been hit by the car. I called the police to report the accident, and we had to wait at the scene so that they could get our reports of what happened.

Fortunately, she told me and I was really mad because I was being betrayed by someone I trusted. I forgave him in my heart but I can't be friends with him anymore. I just can't bring myself to trusting him and considering him my friend anymore. What's sad is that he's put my life out of balance now because I don't trust anyone anymore because of that betrayal. When this best friend of mine betrayed me and badmouthed me to my fiancee, she told me and I was really mad because I was being betrayed by someone I trusted. I forgave him in my heart but I can't be friends with him anymore. I just can't bring myself to trusting him and considering him my friend anymore. What's sad is that he's put my life out of balance now because I don't trust anyone anymore because of that betrayal. That being said, I was happy that my fiancee trusted me enough to alert me about it and get my side before believing anything that friend was telling her. I appreciate her now more than ever and know that whatever life throws at us we'll get through it if we trust each other enough to communicate about everything, good or bad. This event helped me learn a few important lessons. One is that we get betrayed by the people we trust most. Second is that communication is key to success in a relationship.","label":1}
{"text":"Just a little bit shy of three months ago, I had to put my little dog Ginny down. This was incredibly hard for me because dogs to me are not just dogs, they are treasured family members, it was losing a family member to me. I also just could not believe that this was happening. I took her to the Veterinarian three weeks ago for what I was assuming would be allergies, only for them to tell me that she had lumps that had to be tested. We did a blood test and a biopsy and the results came back as Lymphoma, as rather aggressive form. I took her to a specialized Canine Oncologist, which I did not even know existed, to find out what Ginny's options were. It was disappointing for me to learn that at  best, she had about nine months to live, but if I put her through Chemotherapy, they had a large chance of being good months. I put a lot of thought into it, and ultimately decided that it was worth it to try Chemo, if there was a chance I could give her some more good time, I would. I took her to her first treatment and everything seemed to go well, she was in treatment for the afternoon, I was able to pick her up after work. When I picked her up it was like I had the old Ginny back, she was lively and engaging and so excited about her meal, which she had not been for a while. These feelings of normalcy lasted for two days, by the time she was due for her next treatment, she was just as tired and worn out as she had been. I was told that this was normal, but I was not sure, it seemed like Ginny was not having the responses that she should have. When I picked her up from the second treatment, she was off, she was not lively like the first time, she just seemed exhausted. Later that night I had to call the animal ER to answer questions about Ginny's condition, she was refusing food and water and just seemed so sick. By the next day her symptoms only intensified, she became incontinent. I decided that this was an indignity that she should not have to suffer, she was having a terrible quality of life and I needed to do right by her. That day, surrounded by loving family members, we let her go, it was the right move, but so hard.","label":1}
{"text":"The night was young and I had just gone over to a new friend's house, who I also had romantic feelings for. We had made plans earlier in the week to take acid that night. We both took a tab and waited for it to hit us before we walked to the bank. She needed to get the money out and it would be more fun that way, which it was. Once the effects started to kick in, the euphoria, seeing shapes and interesting images, we got up and left for the bank which was about half a mile away. It started pouring rain, which would've sucked any other time, but since we were both tripping on acid we took our shoes off. We were walking through the grass and talking about how good it felt on acid. At one point we started talking about our ancestors that walked there before us. We felt the universe both within us and flowing through us. We started playing music and singing along to Lady Gaga, the whole shabang. I remember my goal was to just make sure she got home safely, as she was definitely tripping harder than I was. We got to the bank, and tried our best to get the atm to work. It was going on 1 AM at this point.  Even while tripping, we eventually got it to work and made it home fine, somehow managing not to step on glass. Once we got in we both took another half tab. We almost ended up having sex, but were too giggly and disorientated to get to it. We ended up cuddling and it was during this where I felt like our bodies had merged into one. It was the most intimate experience I ever had with another human being.","label":1}

{"text":"I had the opportunity to be an officiant for my best friends wedding last month and it was one of the best days of my life. I met with the couple leading up to the wedding and made sure to go through their wants and wishes in detail. From that I made a list of what to include and not include during the ceremony and began writing a script. Building the script was probably the single most stressful part of this work. I generally have a lot of words. Still, finding the right ones to say proved to be incredibly challenging here. I went through at least five different drafts of the speech before I settled on something that I really loved. This really was a labor of love. At the rehearsal I made significant modifications to the script based on my own experience and understanding of the couple. The initial reaction was incredibly positive. Still, I wanted perfection and went back to the drawing board. On the day of the ceremony I was incredibly excited but nervous. My friend was a wreck and needed a lot of emotional support. As we walked up to the altar together I gave him words of encouragement and got into my speech. It was a beautiful ceremony and something I will never forget. Being able to do this for him is one of the highlights of my life.","label":1}

{"text":"In the last few months, I had my first same-sex relationship with a woman. She was really wonderful. I feel really comfortable with her and felt like I could be my genuine self. We came from very similar backgrounds in terms of class (i.e., working class) and some other life experiences. We met first on a dating app and talked for along time this past winter, but then I actually ghosted her because I had two family members die in a mass shooting which was so rough, and I couldn't handle my shit. But then, I reached back out to her again in July, and she immediately asked me out on a date. We have been hanging out a lot, but now she is not sure if she wants to keep hanging out. I am poly which means that I have a partner who is heterosexual and male-identified. He is extremely supportive of me dating women and not in the bisexual fetishization way, if that makes any sense? He is not dating anyone else currently, and she does not want to date anyone else either besides me. She told me a few days ago that she is really falling for me, but is not sure if she can be in a relationship with me because it terrifies her that I'm with someone else at the same time. I have a lot of feels about this because I know that I am falling for her too and would love to pursue things more, especially since the relationship is so new, but feels so right and good.  I think the other complicated factor and layer is that I am also struggling with my sexual orientation. I had originally asked my partner to go poly with me because I needed to figure out who I was, and I had not dated that many people in general: guys or girls. I could tell he was really sad when I told him, but he was extremely supportive. On top of that, we were planning a wedding\/partnership committment at this time, so we almost called that off. We ended up getting committed (we aren't legally married) in June. Everything has been so confusing, and I am feeling quite a breadth of different emotions. I really want to work things out with my girlfriend, but know that there is so much that she needs to figure out. I honestly feel like I could love her because we connected so amazingly. And, I know that she too is falling for me and that her heart is heavy right now. I also know that I need to respect her process. I tried to reassure her that we could do all the things that partners do, like meet my family and plan trips. She seemed very open to that, but also that she feels really sad and terrified. I really hope that things work out.","label":1}

{"text":"About two months ago, I finally had enough courage to propose to my girlfriend of over eight years. We were on a beach vacation, and it was just the two of us. I had decided that this was the perfect place to propose because this was the first time she had ever been to the beach so it was very special for both of us already. I was slightly apprehensive that she would not like the beach and thus might not make the proposal as special as I wanted it to be, but it turned out that she loved it. I had a feeling that she would not suspect anything leading up to the trip, so my surprise was intact. I had purchased the engagement ring in April, and had it ready to go by the time we went on our trip in June. On our drive down I was feeling very nervous because while I knew I wanted to propose on this trip, I did not have a concrete plan on how to do it. But, we were going to be there for five days and four nights, so I knew I had time to make a decision. I finally decided that I wanted to take her out to a quiet part of the beach at around sunset and propose to her close to the water. This is a little cliche, I know, but she always told me she never cared how or where I proposed. I was wearing shorts that allowed me to easily conceal the ring in my pocket so she would never know. Also, I managed to get a local photographer to take pictures of the moment which I had to coordinate very carefully so my girlfriend would not know. We were walking along the beach and as we were doing so I could feel my heart pounding faster and faster as I knew the moment was coming. It was as if every moment and happy memory in our lives over the past eight years had come down to this. In my mind, I knew with absolute certainty that she would say yes, so I finally took her hand and faced her, with the wind whipping up small waves and the sun setting behind us. I got down on one knee and asked her the words that she was waiting to hear for a long, long time. In all honesty the entire moment seems like a blur to me even two months later. All I know and care about is that the woman I love said yes, it was just as magical a moment as I wanted it to be.","label":1}

We all bought beer hats. We stuck cans of beers on them and strolled along. The lights were really something to look at. Not to mention the beauties walking by. We saw people trying to get us into the various clubs. A lot of promoters trying to get us into the gogo bars too. We had a nice drink at the MGM Grand. From there, we went down to a few bars to bar hop. A lot of good beer on tap. We even met another tour group. They gave us some more tips. We followed it and had a blast overall.","label":0}

I can't believe I did this to myself. I even promised myself that I would only be a spectator at the French Open. How am I going to recover the funds that I lost? I know I have an addiction and I think it's time I get some help for it. I'm never going to save enough money to buy a new car or a new house if I keep doing this. I might have to stop going to these events. I seem to be tempted just being in a situation where I can make a bet. At least if I'm at home, I can't be as tempted. I wonder if I can find someone to talk to. I really want to start saving money instead and I am not helping myself in any way. I'll have to look for more work in order to get some more income. I just can't be tempted to bet that money too. So here's me saying it right now. I need help. I don't know where and how I'll get it yet, but I'm starting with step one and saying that I need help controlling my temptations and setting up long-term financial stability.","label":0}
{"text":"These past few months have really taught me a lot.  Of course, the time I spent looking for a job was stressful.  There were times when I thought that I would never find another job and that I would end up living on the street.  I thought this even though I knew that I could survive off of my savings for a few months and that I had marketable skills.  Still, it was a stressful time.  There were times when I thought that I should have just stayed with the soul-sucking miserable job that paid well.  More importantly though, I realized that life is too short to stay in a job just because it pays well.  I know that some people need to stay in miserable jobs because they have no other choice but I am talking about a different situation.  For me, everybody said that my first year associate position at a Big Law firm was what everybody is supposed to want and that it would be the ticket to happiness.  I was made to feel that walking away from the job that had me working 65 hours\/week, waking up stressed, not seeing family and friends and losing myself was what I was supposed to do.  I felt like I would have thrown my education away if I quit.  I now have a job that I love.  While I make a bit less money, I am able to achieve the perverbial work-life balance.  I worl 40 hours\/\/week and really like  my co-workers.  Also, I am given substantially more responsibility in this job so I think that I will grow more professionally.  I do not regret my decision in the least.  I realized that I need to live my life for me - not for others.","label":0}

I tried my best to make the experience good for them. I invited them up to Martha's Vineyard for a nice little getaway. We coordinated times over the course of a few days. We were able to see some llamas happily grazing in the fields. We also ate some fantastic food, and I was introduced to places I hadn't been to yet. It was hard to take this time to just take a step back and appreciate everything. It was all like a whirlwind. It all was happening so fast. I didn't really want it to end. The best part was that at no point did I ever feel like a third wheel. I felt like it was just three friends hanging out and enjoying each other's company. We ended the little vacation by relaxing on the beach.","label":0}

{"text":"Just about 5 months ago now, I reached an all time low. I had been unemployed by then for six months after an unexpected layoff. I was turning in applications everywhere and not so much as receiving a call back in return. I had no one to help me in the immediate area and my meager savings was running out fast. I was having to consider selling my car or sell blood or something to make ends meet. My outlook on life shifted and I was beginning to lose hope. I had a friend out of nowhere reach out to me one weekend offering me a position where she works in an office for the sewer plant. The job didn't pay much and I was kind of embarrassed to go to work for the sewer plant of all places. I was kind ready to brush off the offer but something told me to just check it anyway. So I did. On the following Monday, I came into the office for an interview. I immediately felt at ease. The office was small and very friendly. It turns out a couple of people I knew from the lay off had acquired jobs at the office as well. My interview went great, which never happens for me. I was offered a bump up on the pay due to past experience. The benefits that were offered far exceeded my expectations. I took the job before leaving. I've now been working at the plant for awhile and things couldn't be better. I'm being trained for a supervisor role and have made some really good friends while on the job. I couldn't ask for more. This has been the answer to my prayers.","label":0}

However, I got sucked into a major presentation! I couldn't believe it. On the second day I ran into Bob from the 8th grade team. He mentioned that their main speaker had caught the measles and was under quarantine and asked would I please step in since he new I have a masters in science education. Well, I was pretty surprised. First of all, I didn't even realize Bob was at the conference - I thought it was just the grade level leads. Secondly, I had no idea what their presentation proposal had been. But, Bob looked pretty upset so I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, show I'm a team player and all that. Well, then I found out that the presentation was at 4pm that afternoon. Talk about no time to prepare! So I'm madly checking out their presentation outline, their slides, and their purpose and thinking \"I can't believe this.\" I basically gave up a whole day of the conference in order to save Bob's rear. I sure hoped it wouldn't be as bad as I thought. I can't believe I'm going to say this, but the presentation went so well, I was mobbed at the end! So many people came up to chat and exchange cards.

I didn't think to check the weather, as it seemed promising all that day. As soon as the kid and I were alone, however, it started to rain. And then the rumbling thunder accompanied by frequent flashes of lightning. To make it better, the storm cell was right over our town, so we got to hear it from right underneath. I hate storms, and have an irrational fear of them. I put on my best brave face, but I think flinching every time I saw lightening, or heard thunder gave me away. The kid, awesome as he is, had me sit down with him, and told me that playing games helps take your mind off of things you're scared of. Responding without thinking, I told him it was good advice. He just gave me a look, and said that I told him that all of the time when he's scared. I almost wanted to manly cry, I was so flattered. I ended up laughing, instead, thankfully. He then told me that even when I was an old man in a thunder storm, he'd always be there to play games with me. Like I said, I love this kid like he were my own, and I'm thankful that he thinks of me as family, and we'll always be in each others' lives.","label":0}

Several months ago, a 5-year-old patient came into the unit with some common symptoms - fever, chills, etc. but could not get a specific diagnoses. I was assigned to be the PCA working with this child during their stay. My main duties included parent and child education, what to expect, general bathing\/cleaning\/feeding, etc. One day, while I was alone in the room with my patient, he suddenly went into cardiac arrest. I immediately buzzed for assistance and began performing CPR. It was the first time in my career that I had done so, and although I had significant and extensive training, I had never performed CPR on a human being. As help arrived, I continued the CPR until the patient regained a normal rhythm. This event was one of the scariest moments of my life. In front of me was a 5-year-old boy whose parents were at work and had no idea that this was happening and his life was essentially in my hands at that moment. Although he survived and was eventually discharged, this event has stuck with me forever. Immediately after, I went to the bathroom and cried. I realized how physically and emotionally demanding and draining this job was. I never realized the lasting impact that a patient can have. Most come in for routine things - asthma, appendicitis, etc. and have a short stay that leads to a happy and healthy discharge.

During this time I was to abstain from social media, television, lustful thoughts, cursing, swearing, and sweets for 1 month. The purpose of this cleanse was to test my willpower. In addition to this, I made it my priority to test my spiritual faith during this time, The cleanse proved to be difficult at first but became progressively easier. During the first week, I struggled to tame my mind in the presence of temptation. I did experience a significant relapse. It was discouraging. After the first 2 weeks, I felt more clear minded. After 3 weeks, I felt stronger both spiritually, physically, and mentally. I was able to keep my composure in stressful situations with less effort. At this point, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. After the 1 month period, I began to question how was I suppose to transition back to regular life. The cleanse ultimately did the job. I felt proud of myself for successfully enduring this personal test. I tested my willpower and found out that cutting out certain things in my life deepened my spirituality and improved my overall state of wellness.","label":1}

I slowly back away from him and move a large biohazard garbage bin (on wheels) between him and I. I move slowly to the door and reach for the handle. He points the gun at me and yells not to open the door. I assure him that I'm not going to open the door, I was just holding the handle so no one else opened it. I asked him to please let me leave. He reiterated \"don't open the door\". I remained calm and tried to keep him calm as well as he remained on the phone with the police. Once more, I stated \"please let me leave. I want to go on the other side of the door and guard it for you\". At this point, he pointed the gun at the ground and told me to leave.","label":1}

I finally got the courage to tell her how her hitting me when I was younger really affected me and she still feels like she's justified in it.  I mean, WHO HITS HER KID??!!  Especially when it was for something so dumb like not cleaning my room.  Yea I know I should have just cleaned it, but it's not THAT serious.  I just cant get past it.  I want mom to say at least she's sorry for it and then maybe we can move on.  I can't forgive it right now.  I want her to acknowledge she did something wrong, for once.  She never admits anything.  She thinks she's right about EVERYTHING!  UGH, so frustrating.  Sometimes I just hate her. Why do parent's do that.  Just say, oops I made a big mistake and it wont happen again.  I want our relationship to go back to when we were happy and talking.  I can't even look at her these past 2 weeks.  Ok, that's all for now, I'll type more later.","label":0}
{"text":"It's been a long, tough, challenging road, but man it feels incredible to be where I am now. It's crazy to think about where I was 6 months ago. It feels like it was such a long time ago now. Things were so hectic, after the breakup, with the difficulties at work, and how much I was eating just to try to distract myself from everything. I couldn't believe the person I was seeing when I was looking in the mirror back then. Thinking about that, I can't believe the person I'm seeing when I look in the mirror now. It really took me hitting rock bottom, when I was struggling to walk up the flight of stairs at home and was dead out of breath for me to finally look at myself and try to get a plan together to turn things around. But I did it! Thanks to all the hard work and the support of my friends, family, and community I found myself a part of at the local gym, I was able to stick to my plan and turn things around. It got really challenging at times, especially early on when I wasn't seeing any results. It was tough to see all my friends enjoying themselves, throwing down pizza and ice cream and not being able to be a part of it. But it was worth sticking to my plan. Hey, maybe I'll be able to join them soon! I hope I can be an inspiration to someone else at some point. I want to write down all the steps I took, and all the thoughts that went through my head, especially early on. There were a lot of times I doubted myself, so I want to make sure I make note of all those things in case I can pass them forward to someone else some day. I'll be detailing all those thoughts and how I addressed them in my coming entries.","label":0}
{"text":"A few months ago I was trying to get on top of my financial situation. I am three years out of school now with student loans to be repaid. I thought it would be a responsible thing to do. I decided to run a full credit report on myself as I have never done one before. I never understood why my credit score was so low. I have always made payments on time, never kept a balance, and barely used my cards. When I saw the results, I was shocked. I had two credit cards that were basically maxed out that I never knew about. I called the company that said I had accounts there and they said payments were being made on them so it doesn't seem to be fraud and I should ask people I know. So, it turns out my own parent had falsely opened the cards under my name. I had 12,000 in credit card debt because of that associated with my name. And this is on top of my student loans! I was so upset and hurt by this. I forced her to find a way to pay it back and get it off my name. Eventually she did. I am still hurt and weary of it all.","label":1}
{"text":"I was on my way back from a trip with my mother, brother, and partner and our return flight got canceled for unknown reasons. We got up at 5 am and went to the airport anyway and found out that several flights for our airline had been canceled due to hail damage to the plane. The line to re-book at the airline counter was extremely long and workers suggested we re-book on our own. When I went online to check out alternate flights home, I saw that we could not fly out on the same airline till two days later. My mother and I do not have the greatest relationship so I was very eager to get home and away from her. I found the prospect of two more days with her very frustrating. I also needed to be back in town for work. I was extremely frustrated and anxious trying to decide what to do. My mother does not know how to book flights or use travel sites so I re-booked us on a much more expensive flight from another airline. I felt extremely stressed about the cost but I knew I needed to get back ASAP. The flight I booked ended up being $515 a person, compared to the original $100 a person. I put all of the tickets on my credit card because I know my mom has bad credit and also would have to carry over a balance for a few months to pay it off. I really hated having all of that on my card and feared I would never be reimbursed. The flight I booked also required us to wait in the airport for 7 hours. I have a pretty intense fear of flying, so the anticipation was also distressing. Overall it was a very distressing experience and it made me not want to travel for a while.","label":1}
{"text":"Today was like any other day, I was happy and in love. When I say this came out of nowhere I really mean it. I woke up and did my morning ritual. I made coffee and breakfast for myself and my girlfriend. We normally survive on coffee and something simple to eat. I cooked our favorite which we, I, call egg in a hole. As soon as my girlfriend, or should I say ex-girlfriend by now, entered the kitchen, something felt off. I looked at her face and got a tinge of fear. She looked so serious when she's normally so bubbly. From that moment, all time slowed down but yet everything felt like a blur. First she said she needed to talk to me. I panicked and she must have saw it because she tried to calm me. She said that had found someone else and was no longer in love with me. My heart sank. It came out of nowhere, or I missed all the signs. I begged and pleaded with her not to leave me. I might have made a fool of myself, I cringe when I think of it. I was crushed and began to cry. She left after eating. I couldn't eat and just went to my bed. I drifted in and out of sleep because when I slept it didn't hurt.","label":0}

We went to a place that we all know well where we ordered our first round of drinks. After a few rounds, one of my friends brought us another round. It was around our fifth or so and things were really getting loosened up. As I was drinking my drink and slurrping what was left at the bottom of the glass, I saw something pink. I played with it with my straw thinking it was a chunk of fruit or something. That's when I realized it was a finger nail!! i was so grossed out, I dropped the glass and it broke on the floor. It was super embarrassing because it caused a little scene. The bouncer came by and said I had enough to drink. I tried to tell him there was a nail in my glass, but he wasn't believing me since our bachelorette group was pretty loud at this point. When I dropped the glass, the nail was no where to be found, so I had no evidence. I was cut off from drinks and our group was under scrutiny after that. I didnt ruin the party, but it sure put a damper in things! We will all remember this night forever. Eventually, we went to another place, but it wasnt as fun as the first.","label":1}

{"text":"Dear Journal,When it happens, we're usually drinking. It starts out innocent enough, and the night usually begins with us having fun. Somewhere along the line someone says something that rubs one of us the wrong way. Last night, it was probably him. Or maybe it was me. I don't even know what triggered the fight, and it was our first physical fight in a very long time. Stress seems to get things going even more. It's just hard, because I feel like I have no one to talk to but a damn notebook. These pages are my only peace. All day every day, I'm cooking and cleaning and chasing Jane around the house. Don't get me wrong, I love my Jane. She was my fate, and something I wanted for so long. But it's hard having a toddler again, and it's hard having teenagers when Sam is never home. When he is home he drinks or sits on the couch all day watching Netflix or other dumb movies. He doesn't try to interact unless he's drinking, and when he's drinking there's only a brief moment in time where he's fun and not angry or annoying or ... everything else. Don't get me wrong, I love him. But the fight last night makes me feel as if staying with him for all these years was bad on my kids. Is it going to be bad on Jane too? Did we fuck up our children by making things work despite all the fights they've seen and the mean words we've said to each other. Last night made me feel as if I should leave...but I can't. I have no where to go. I sacrificed everything, my whole life for this family. I had to...someone had to...and yet now I'm stuck.","label":1}
{"text":"My wife an i recently went on vacation to Jamaica. We always wanted to go there. It was as nice as we expected. The water was warm and the colors were gorgeous. The atmosphere where we stayed was exciting. It was a romantic setting. The trip rekindled our sexual explorations. We decided to take a boat trip to an island where you swim and tan naked. We had always wanted to try this. We wanted the feel of being naked in the hot son and warm water. When we arrived there was around 25 people there. Some were couples while some were single. It was a small island so there was no hiding or privacy. We stripped naked after about 15 minutes. It was so exciting. The warm tropical breeze in the hot son aroused us completely. I almost instantly became fully erect. We waded into the beautiful water. There were people in the water already and i noticed a couple staring at my erect penis and my wife's beautiful ass and breasts. Her nipples were big to begin with but i have never seen them so erect and stiff as they were now. I came up from behind my wife and grabbed her breasts and started pinching her right nipple. Her right nipple is very sensitive and this immediately made my wife moan. I guided my hard penis into her from behind,we did not care who was watching. My wife grinded her ass against me and within minutes we both came hard. The orgasm was one of the most intense ones we ever had.","label":1}

I see him walking around the house like he\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s lost, not knowing what to do at points. I joke with him saying now that you have soo much free time you don\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t know what to do with yourself. We have to joke about it because if we don\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t it gets depressing. I had to become the breadwinner in the family, but what I bring home is nothing compared to what hubby did.

I\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4m at a loss at how to help him really, he has always been my support system and now when he needs me, I\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4m not sure how to help.

And I believe I love him more now. I was surprised when he turned down a job that paid the same, but was in a different state.

Even so, I knew we would all have a great time. As it turned out, some of us had a little bit too much of a good time! My cousin has always been kind of a problem drinker and we all hoped he would control himself this time. This was not the case. The day started out great. A lot of catching up and laughs. It was around lunch time and we all decided to get something to eat. A few others had a drink, nothing unusual, but my cousin went overboard.

{"text":"My uncle Harold died 3 weeks ago. It came as a shock to all of us. He was a very healthy man. That was what was most surprising. I mean, how could a fifty-year-old man in perfect health just not wake up one morning? Of course, his wife (my sister) took it the hardest. I've never seen that level of frustration and anger and sadness on someone's face before. And the fact that that was happening to my sister was almost as hard to take as the death itself. My parents took care of all the funeral arrangements and things like that. Harold didn't have any immediate family close by. In fact, only five people showed up to the funeral who were related to him. That was really awkward. About 30 or so people showed up from our side of the family, and our friends. Harold was sort of a loner and didn't really have many friends, just mainly acquaintances. So I guess that makes sense. Still, I would have thought that some of his coworkers could make it. I'm not sure if my sister will ever really get over this. Time will tell.","label":0}
{"text":"Approximately 3 weeks ago, I got the best news I've received in a long time at work. I was notified by my boss that we exceeded our sales goals for the year. I think the most noteworthy thing about this is that my team is the youngest team the company has ever had. I think our average age is only 22 years old!  I knew something was happening when my boss asked me to come into his office. Once I got in there he had a big smurk on his face, so I knew then it must be good.  He immediately told me that we exceeded our goal by 25%, and that our salaries would be increasing as a result. I've worked so hard the past year to make this goal happen, I'm thrilled that its finally actually happening. With all the extra money I'll be making, I can now pay off my student loans that much faster. It's been quite a struggle the past 12 months paying my regular bills and my student loans. Now that I'll have this extra income, I may even have a little left for some fun entertainment after work some nights. After I left the office, my other 4 co-workers were watching me. They knew that they would be called in the office next and could know what to expect before going in there.  As I walked back to my desk, I felt nothing but pride that I had made this happen. Working on this team with my coworkers is going to take us far, and our boundaries are endless.","label":0}

{"text":"It's been a really long few months since I lost my job. I have been searching and looking for a new one every day, but it's a tough market out there. Everybody wants a better job, everybody wants and needs more money, and the competition is stiff. The savings that we have is quickly depleting and there isn't much left after this month. I've been depressed and my anxiety is through the roof lately. I need to be able to put food on the table for my kids, and keep a roof over their heads. A few weeks ago I was searching online for what I could possibly do from home at least for something, anything. Any help at this point would be amazing. Extra groceries, phone bill, electric bill, I don't care, it all needs to be paid anyway. I found some sites that seemed like I could do surveys for some cash, but most paid in gift cards, and you seem to need weeks worth of points to be able to earn a gift card. Then I found Mechanical Turk. It's something Amazon controls, so I looked into it and decided to sign up. It was a few days for me to get my approval, and in which time I did some research to find out what kind of jobs I could expect. The answer to that, was a little bit of everything, and sometimes some seriously crazy stuff. I read stories of some of the crazy things people did. By the time I got my approval, I felt fairly ready to jump right in and hopefully start making some money. The first few days to a week were rough, there aren't many jobs available for a new worker, so I worked for literal pennies an hour. But it got my feet wet. After the first few weeks I started getting into the swing of things, and luckily I've been making some better money. This week alone I've made enough for groceries at least. Is it long tedious hours some days? Yep. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because this is only for the short term until I find something else, and at least my kids are being fed. Not being able to afford the basics really does a number to your self-esteem.","label":0}

So one night he seems even more off than usual and is somewhat short of breath.   I put him in the truck and off we go to the all-night vet.   After a couple hours hanging around in the waiting room the vet summons me into the back to tell me that he had lung cancer.   Christ knows how he got that.   Anyhow, she was of the opinion that maybe we ought to just put him down right then and there, but instead of that she gave me some pain medication for him and home we went.  He lasted a few more weeks, and some of the time he seemed to be doing pretty well.   One morning though it was just time, and we both knew it, so I carried him down to the normal vet and that was that.  His ashes are in a little box now.  On the kitchen table actually.  I suppose I should find somewhere more official for them to go, but he always did like hanging out in the kitchen.   There are worse places to be I guess. It was a rough few months after that.  There's not much to be done about it though.   It's a shame cats don't last longer than that, but such is life.","label":1}

After a few test they found that she would need some more advance testing. After a few advance test, the results come back and she is diagnosed with arterial blockages. She never would have guessed. She had no signs or symptoms of such a diagnoses. She's been going to this doctor for years, she trusted him completely. After speaking it over with the doctor for a solution to this problem he says a stent surgery would be necessary. She gathered us all around to tell us the news. We were hurt to say the least. We didn't want to lose her or anything bad to happen. We backed up her choice to listen to her doctor, we figured she knew best and this was her body. In the back of my head I felt she should have gotten a second opinion cause she had no symptoms for this, there was no sign of it, how did this doctor get this conclusion. But she reassured us that her doctor knew what he was talking about it and she was taking it from there. My boyfriend and I took her to the hospital that morning of the surgery. She was nervous, we were nervous. After, what seemed to feel like an eternity, just 3 hours, the doctor returns to us with news. He tells us she is now in recovery but he has bad news. It turns out she really didn't need the surgery. Her test came back and there was a mistake where her results got mixed up with someone else's. They started the surgery without more test, without a second opinion. We were in outrage, his mother is old she doesn't need unnecessary surgeries.

We get out of the car, and walk the distance to the spirit houses.  It is a cold and peaceful morning as we approach the groups of brightly colored small buildings on the ground.  I explain the history of the cemetery to the kids. The kids are not as religious as I am, and they do not have the connection to the Alaskan people I do, so they did not understand. I walk off by myself to pay my respects.  I stop at each of the little buildings that contained the graves.  I take in the colors, I think about how the family must have felt painting the colors on the little shelters.  Tears come to my eyes.  The native people fascinate me.  They have managed to both embrace a new religion, yet keep their old traditions.  I can feel the peace here, the love.  I stay as long as I can, I could stay all day.  I will surely return as I seem to be called back to this special place at least once a year.","label":0}

A little girl had just been hit by a vehicle. I was terrified. I ran down the street as fast as I could. I ran over to her to check on her. She was bleeding. I called emergency services on my phone. I told them what was happening and they needed to hurry about as fast as they could. They got their and took the girl off to the hospital.","label":0}

{"text":"In July I left the United States for the first time in over 10 years. I went first to the UK but that was just a layover. I was leaving the US to move to Morocco so that I could meet a man I had met online and get to know him with the intent of working together and starting a relationship. This was so important to me because I was starting a new life. I remember getting off the plane. The Agadir airport is so small. I think only about 6 people work there. 2 immigration people, 1 customs person, 2 guys on baggage and 1 information person. I mean it's one of the smallest airports I have ever seen that accept international flights. It's so small they don't even charge you for a baggage cart. I remember getting my bags and heading out the door. I could see A from the foyer. It was the first time I have seen him in person. I was so terrified that he might not like me. I almost went back inside. However I walked outside and met him and it was amazing. Now I have been here for 2 months and I have never been happier.","label":1}

{"text":"Recently I was playing in a local basketball tournament with my team. We won the first two games easily without much trouble. Then we faced the toughest team in the city in the finals. Despite having a nice lead at half time, we struggled in the second half. The game came down to the final few minutes, where we led by a mere one point. In an effort to grab a rebound and give us a nice advantage, I was fouled extremely hard and came down badly on my knee. Right away I knew it was bad. I spent a few minutes writhing around in pain before being helped off the court. I was forced to sit on the bench and ice my knee while the final minutes ticked away. Unfortunately we did not have the size on our bench to replace my height, and it cost us the chance for the championship. The final score was 85-84, and we ended up leaving with a second place trophy. After the game I went to the hospital and they immediately told me I had ruptured a ligament, and would not be able to do much of anything for a while. Thankfully I had surgery quickly, but was unable to walk for a few weeks which was quite frustrating. My main goal however, is to get back to full health in time for next year's big tournament. I think we are more than capable of winning next year if we set our minds to it and can stay healthy!","label":0}

{"text":"The most impressive event in my life so far was the day I participated in the driving exam. When I was 18, I had to leave home to study in another city, so my mother thought that I had better got a motorbike so I could easily travel to school. They intended to buy me a pretty one, but I could only get it after I successfully passed the driving exam. I signed up to study in a training course, and it took me about a week to learn all the theory and traffic law. However, the most difficult part was to pass the practical exam, which required me to ride my motorbike over some obstacles. After another week of practice, I finally got to the driving lot. There were a lot of people there, and all of them were as worried as me. I felt that my heart nearly jumped out of my chest, and I could not keep my hands from shaking. I had been through many tests in different subjects in my student life, but I thought that was the only one that made me freak out. The 8 line was the most difficult part, and many people failed to pass it. It made me even more stressful, but my father told me to watch them closely so I could avoid the same mistakes. My name was finally called, and I could not remember exactly how I walked towards the lot, got on the motorbike and finished my turn. I heard something but my vision was blurred, but I was attempted to complete the ride well. My dad almost yelled when I got out, and I was so happy that I hug him really tight. Maybe it is just an ordinary license that anyone can get, but for me it is such a great process and effort","label":1}
{"text":"Three months ago I helped my brother move into his college dorm room. I didn't realize how many emotions it would stir up from my old college days. When I moved into my dorm room I was so nervous about what my room mate would be like and how well we would get along. My brother on the other hand was excited at the thought of meeting someone new that he could possibly become life long friends with.  I saw my brother decorating his room and how much fun he was having doing. When I went to college I was so nervous and anxious that I didn't even think about what my decor would be. After he was done decorate his side of the room we decided to walk around campus to get a feel for how everything was. When we got to his cafeteria I have to admit I was a little bit jealous because the food variety was way better than what my school offered. As we toured the rest of campus together I looked around at all the other new freshmen and it brought back all those feelings of what I felt on my first day. I was a little sad after I realized college was so many years ago. Those were the days when I had so little responsibility. I remember thinking would I meet any cute guys. Would I make friends? I was scared of failing and letting my family down. Would I pick the right major? How would I know what major was right for me? Then I realized this wasn't about me but about my little brother. We walked back to his dorm and his room mate had showed up. I looked at him and I could see him beaming with the biggest smile. I knew he would be alright. I hugged him and told him I'll talk to him later and can't wait to hear how things went.","label":0}

{"text":"My wife and I traveled to Italy and did an amazing hike in the Dolomite mountain range. I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning and for about four hours we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there was loose rocks under us for much of it. Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally after what I figured was another false top, we came up and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us spreading for 360 degrees were what seemed like thousands of craggly mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry it was so beautiful. There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to transverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she suprised herself. It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.","label":1}

Despite our reassurances that we would still love him just the same, he was still upset about it. We thought he would warm to the idea as my pregnancy went on. But as it got closer to my delivery date, he was still saying that he didn't want a sibling. I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy. One day my water broke and we were off to the hospital. There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section. It was a really scary experience, but my daughter was born healthy. When we brought our son in to meet his new little sister, he had a scowl on his face. He kept up his dislike for his sister for a few days. Eventually, he was won over by how cute she was. Now that my daughter is 3 years old, her brother loves her so much.

Well at that same time my wife became ill. Not sure what was wrong with her but it may have been Lyme disease that she got from a tick bite while on a camping trip a few weeks before. So not only was she ill she was an ill mood. She started taking out her anger and dissatisfaction at being sick on me because she said I wasn't \"taking care of her.\" Not sure what she wanted me to do but I was busy packing. Then at one point she flew into a rage and said I shouldn't come back after I finished my work in the mountains. I was taken aback by this but didn't say anything. I knew if I started arguing with her it would erupt into a huge argument. I couldn't do it. So I didn't say anything. I could not have my travel preparations interrupted. I was already afraid I was going to be late because I had started preparing later than I should have.   That was 2 1\/2 months ago. I haven't  called her or spoken to her since that day nor has she called me. Although I'm sad about breaking up I feel it was time for that to happen.

Once we got there we saw a few of our other friends and hiked to the rock with them. It was enormous and towering over us. I made the first climb because I was familiar with the climb. It felt good, but the rock was a bit slippery from the rain the night before. Our other friend went next. He was about halfway up and lost his grip. He fell about 20 ft and missed the pads we had laid out for protection. We heard a snap and knew that his leg broke. We made a splint for his leg and all worked together to carry him out. It felt like it took hours, but was only maybe 15 minutes. We got him back to the car and drove to the hospital. They set his leg and put a cast on him. He wasn't allowed to climb for quite some time, but overall he was okay.","label":1}
{"text":"Dear Diary,I have been so busy lately, I didn't have time to write about my experiences in Ghana four months ago. I was nervous to travel so far to celebrate my mother's birthday since I have never been on a plane before. Mother insisted we go to Ghana because she wanted to see the local wildlife and it had been her dream for years. I was nervous to be in a new place where I wasn't very familiar with the culture. Eventually, once I got to know a few locals, I was able relax and enjoy my time there. One young lady that I met was a tour guide on a local safari.  Her name was Julie and she was so lively and lovely. She was enthusiastic about showing us around and was very good at her job. I could feel the chemistry as we joked around together the entire day. At the end of the day, I didn't want to say goodbye. I knew I had  to take a risk and ask her for her number. The next day I texted her after we had gone out to lunch and asked if she was free to meet a small cafe. To my surprise, she agreed and actually seemed excited. We really hit it off and agreed to stay in touch after I returned to America. So, for the last few months we have been texting every day. We try to video chat or talk on the phone as much as possible. I am so thankful for this trip and the opportunity to get to know Julie. I really think she is the love of my life. We are already planning a future together. I am going to ask her to marry me when she comes to the US to visit next month.

{"text":"Recently I was looking to purchase a home. While doing so I listed my house for sale by owner. While a house I wanted to purchase did not work out my home still was for sale online and someone decided to see it.  A few days later a lady came over to look at the house with her realtor. She spent about an hour there checking it out. About an hour after leaving her realtor called and they put a cash offer on my house that I could not refuse. Because she was a cash buyer the sale of the house was scheduled within 3 weeks of signing the agreement. I went from casually looking for a house to 3 weeks out from the sale. I had to quickly find a rental while I look for my new house. It took me almost 10 days to find a place that I wanted to sign a lease for but I did end up finding one. Between getting the keys and signing the papers I had a total of 6 days to move my entire home.  The home inspection went well then it was down to the closing. The closing went smoothly and I walked out no longer being a home owner. Definitely a really random and stressful situation that worked great in my favor. All in all it was a great success.","label":1}
{"text":"The most memorable event for me in the last few months was going to a cheese festival. My fiance's mom wanted to come visit us that weekend but we had already had plans to go to this festival. She decided that she would come with us as well. It was so hot outside, in the upper 80s. The event was outdoors, on the streets, with no respite from the sun. This made it challenging for vendors to keep their cheeses cold and stocked. The event drew a bigger crowd than they had imagined. Many vendors started selling out of their most popular items within the first few hours.  We found a small cafe that had a table available after being told that it would be over an hour wait at the location we originally planned to eat at. We quickly realized why the cafe was so empty. The food was like something they would serve at Fyre Festival. The Caesar salad was just a few pieces of lettuce and dressing. We could complain, but we were just so relieved to be inside and out of the heat. Later, we found humor in the conditions of the food we ordered. This is a found memory for me because I do not often get to spend time with my future mother in law, so it was nice to have time to bond.","label":1}

After about 4 hours water started coming in the house. We grab some bags & our dog in the husbands truck & went down the road to a friends house.

Now that the excitement has worn off though, I'm feeling a little bored. I'm starting to understand why the work pays so well. It's just so repetitive! If I didn't need the money so badly, I'd hand in my resignation tomorrow! I can't wait to look for something new. Still I'm afraid of looking for another job, because I may not find something as well paying as this one. Additionally, I know it looks super bad on a resume to skip out on a job after only a month! I honestly wish I had read more reviews on this job before I applied. The interview process was so long as well! It took almost a month for me to receive a formal job offer! That seems insane right? I know a lot of companies take that long, but with a company turn over this high, you'd think they would've been able to move it along a little faster. I remember going to the first interview, almost dying from nervousness! I wondered at the time if my boss could see it, and that seemed to make me even more nervous. I actually had to hold my leg down to keep it from shaking because when I get nervous that tends to happen. I guess it most not have bothered him too much since I got the job. I was only made more nervous not to get a formal job offer and be strung along for weeks.  Anyway, I'll try to stick this out for awhile and build up some savings so I can look for something else.

I wanted to go somewhere less touristy and with more culture, but Tom has wanted to visit the Bahamas ever since his best friend Alex went with her husband.

New drinks were brought to us at the moment our glasses had become dry. The beach and the water were so beautiful. The water was a vivid turquoise color, just like you see in the commercials. The weather was perfect except for one day, when it rained hard. Tom and I used that time to go to a local cultural museum, which I felt right at home at. I enjoyed learning about the history of the Bahamian people. There were several events that we enjoyed participating in during our stay. Every night there was a dinner where you could eat with other couples. We made these wonderful friends, Jim and Sue, who were our companions throughout the trip. My favorite events were the late night parties. There was dancing under the light of the fire from the tiki torches. The DJ was talented and played a great mix of music, including hits and deep cuts. Everyone was in a cheerful mood, and I found it contagious. My favorite event was the carnival that we attended a few miles away from the resort. There were so many elaborate costumes, amazing food, and live music. Coming home from the trip, I felt utterly relaxed and rejuvenated. I will cherish the memories from this trip forever.","label":0}

{"text":"Three to six months ago I graduated from college. This moment was memorable because I was finally closing a chapter in my life that had took so much of my time. I remember getting ready that day. I woke up early because I wanted to do my hair and makeup. I wanted to have the time to make it perfect. But, I quickly realized not everything was going to turn out perfect when my hair would just not curl. The time was already to go and I didn't have my dress on or my makeup up done. As the clock zoomed by, I was in a crying fit as my mom rushed me into my dress and I walked to the car with no shoes on and no makeup. Already a day I had dreamed about, planned out so perfectly was already ruined. I knew it I could feel it deep in my gut. The icing on the cake was when I arrived to the arena in my four inch heels and realized the floor was completely concrete, and I would have to stand for hours one in. This day could not have turned out worse. I just wanted to go home and get my diploma in the mail. I realized this event was not for me. I wasn't doing if for me. I was just happy to graduate and wanted to take a nap after a long 18 credit semester. I was doing all this for my family. But this moment made me realize that moments you dream about don't always turn out as planned.","label":1}

She was going to have a baby a few weeks earlier than expected.  I just arrived in Bali the previous month and I had to turn around to be with my daughter.  When I arrived at the Dallas airport, I got a text message from my son-in-law.  It was accompanied by a picture of my granddaughter.  She was my first grandchild.   I was excited but was sad that I was not there when the baby was born.  It was a joy to see the baby.  She was healthy considering she was born earlier than expected.  I felt so blessed.

We were both so excited and couldn't wait to start looking into getting the room ready. When we heard that we were actually about to have twins, I just couldn't believe it! We were so happy! On the way home we just talked and talked about names and room designs. We let all our families know and talked in great detail about everything we had planned to do. But now I feel like everything is falling apart. Our marriage seems to be struggling and just going the through the day is harder than it has ever been. We haven't been fighting but we are surely slowly drifting apart, I don't think either of us has any blame for the other but still there is a void forming. Every day I wonder if things will get better. We try to communicate through small talk but it falls short every time. Neither of use really have interest in watching our shows. We no longer are wanted to get out into the world and experience things. I don't know how we will ever recover but I really hope we do. I really hope we can recover from this but it is very hard. I don't even know how to begin telling our families. Hopefully we can get the strength to over come this. Maybe we will try again once we heal. But as it stands now I don't see that coming anytime soon.","label":0}

{"text":"We were always worried about her. When she was born she had this diagnosis of having mild down syndrome. The wife and I were shocked. We completed a number of testing beforehand. Everything we saw showed up as almost no chance of any mental development issues. I know that these tests aren't perfect. It was discussed at length and we did a lot of research. Our doctor went over it a bunch of times. We were thoroughly convinced that she would be born without any sort of these problems. Sure enough, by about age 1 or so, she showed signs of being, different. We were concerned so we took her in to a specialist. They did a battery of testing that took a few months. At first they figured it was just a simple case of her taking a bit longer than most kids learning simple things. But then the diagnosis came back with downs syndrome. We worked with a number of therapists and behavior experts for a few years. Slowly and surely, the outward signs were almost gone and we were very happy about this. Sure enough, now that she is in 1st grade, there's nothing that one can see to tell you that she has this disorder. She is just like any normal kid and even though she technically has downs, she has thus far battled over all of the hurdles that it presented. This is why we are so darn proud of her. She worked very hard to get here. I hope this continues but at this very moment, we are beyond thrilled about this whole thing. We literally could not be happier for her","label":0}

He grew up in California, and he used to go to a beach out there with his grandfather in the summers. His grandfather passed away while he was in Iraq, and I know it means a lot to him to get married near that same beach. So we're just going to make it happen somehow. We've booked the Rotary Club near there for afterwards and our parents will do all the cooking and decorating and stuff. It'll be fine. Pictures were sort of extra, I guess. I just really thought it would be nice to have some. For later, I mean.\"Lately I'd been photographing too many weddings that felt more like theatrical productions with a cast of three-hundred-and fifty and featuring every kind of over-the-top excess.

It was just a couple of days before she and Tom were due to drive to California.\"I wanted to check in with you about a few things,\" she said. \"I'm not sure if I told you that my dad is performing the ceremony.\"\"That must be really nice for you.\"\"Yes, it is.\" She hesitated a moment before going on. \"He's just about the sweetest man you'll ever meet.

We spent a long day exploring the city and eating all of the good food that we could find. We were shocked by the cheap prices and the amazing view. We went to visit all of the cultural relics that you only read about in history books. At night after a nice of dancing and drinking, I thought it was the perfect time to show her, my best friend and girlfriend the gift I got her. I took her hiking up a tall mountain so we could see the whole city from the mountain side. As we glared at the beautiful city lights against a awesome night sky. I dropped down on one knee and asked her to marry me and to be my best friend and wife for the rest of my life. She shook her head yes as tears rolled down her cheeks, so surprised that I picked this awesome moment to propose. It was an awesome moment that none of us will ever forget.

{"text":"June 16, 2019 to June 23, 2019 we took our first family beach vacation to Ocean Isle Beach North Carolina. It was me, my husband and 3 boys who were 11, 6 and 1 years old at the time. I was very nervous about how easy and relaxing it would be with 3 boys at the beach, especially with my 1 year old, but it went so smooth and was so much fun! Our condo was beach front and we had an umbrella and chairs set up for us every morning so that made things very easy with 3 boys! It was also very nice to already have a spot saved for us. We spent every day down at the beach. My kids had a blast in the water and on the sand, riding the waves in the water and building sand castles in the sand. Not once was I stressed and not once did the boys complain that they were bored! The older two boys played great together and the baby was happy just being there, played in the sand, played in the water, waved to people that were nearby. He loved the beach and whenever he was tired he would crawl up on my lap or my husbands lap and take an hour plus nap. We also played miniature golf one day, got ice cream a couple of the days and went to dinner a couple of the nights. The weather was very hot but it wasn't unbearable. It only rained one of the days which was great! It was honestly one of the best beach vacations I have ever been on, if not the best. It was a very memorable vacation and I will cherish those memories that were made.","label":1}

{"text":"I'm still excited about my last birthday! About a month ago, my family and friends threw me a birthday party to celebrate two very important milestones in my life. The first one, of course, was my 23rd birthday. The second was that I celebrated my first birthday as a man instead of a woman! Last year was the first time I told anyone that I was transgender. When I first told my family and a few close friends, I was really worried that they would reject me. It took a lot of soul searching to go through with it. But except for my oldest sister, my family has accepted me as an evolving man and supported me. I did lose a couple of friends who just couldn't accept me as a man, but I've made new friends in the transgender community who went though the same things (or worse) that I did. I started my hormone replacement therapy this past January and love the changes! My voice is deeper, I'm actually growing a beard (I get to shave my face every third day!) and I'm working out in the gym a couple of times a week to build my muscles.  What's really special to me is the new bond I have with my dad. I was more afraid of losing his love and acceptance than anything, but he took the news surprisingly well. We're forging a new relationship and finding that we have more in common with me as his son instead of his daughter. I love living life in a male body.

Jackson then kept his distance from me and started displaying certain attitude towards me. He started keeping late nights as well and would always scold me when I confront him about it. All I felt at this time was that the whole word was covering up on me because my parents earlier told me that they never where comfortable with my relationship with Jackson. With this, I was devastated. Jackson then came to me one afternoon and said he was calling it off and that was all he wanted. I pleaded that we mend the Issues we had but all that was to no avail as Jackson said he was going to take responsibility of the baby and of course would grant me some benefits.       With this, I ended up wallowing in sorrow and poured all my frustration on alcohol .I spent almost all my days indoors drinking myself out forgetting the fact that I was pregnant and the alcohol could affect the baby. Jackson came by last week with a check in his hand and handed it over to me saying it was my benefit. The check read $50,000 and he said I should use that for my upkeep for the time.     That same day, I went to the bank with the check and on getting there, discovered that he scammed me. The check was fake and at that instant felt a  sharp pain in my tummy and suddenly everywhere went dark. I opened my eyes only to see myself on a hospital bed and few minutes later, discovered that I had a miscarriage just as the nurse was about to say.

I lost the money I had won previously and decided to get some more money. I betted on my usual numbers and the wheel would land 8 greens in a row depleting me of my bank balance and the rest of the money I had for the trip. I made my way back to my room sad and upset I would not play roulette for a long long time. It made me despise the game and I decided I would rather stick to slots.

It was such a great time and I loved every moment of it. We plan on going back the next chance that we get. One of the biggest things that I remember the most was going on a hiking trail with my husband and stopping to sit at the top of the hill. When we were hiking the trail it was really dreary and pale out but the moment we got to the top it was clear and sunny. It was such an amazing view of the entire town that I was so happy. It was so breath taking and such a nice family moment that we got to share together. After the hike we went straight to a local pub that was recommended and had some of the best local beers I've had in a long time. Overall the entire trip was amazing. I couldn't imagine a better way to spend my vacation. It will be something that I cherish till the day that I die. We also ended up getting some souvenirs on the way home.","label":0}
{"text":"That fateful day in June - June Seventh 2019 was a day like any other ordinary day. It began the same, mid way also. The night was what changed everything. I developed and woke up to an extreme pain. This pain radiated in my jaw, teeth, and neck, but was not the ordinary tooth or molar pain. It was intense, extreme, unbearable. Nothing would help it, not over the counter medications, or rest. It was an intense, tremoring pain --- the kind you'd experience during a boxing match or worse, during surgery without numbing. Being that I suffer from anxiety and am getting up there in age, I began to worry. Was this very serious? I contemplated my options all the while suffering. Do I go to the ER? A local Urgent Care? I tried everything I could think of to numb the pain. It was almost as if I was bitten by a poisonous creature. Was it a spider bite? So many things raced through my mind. Eventually, I realized the inside of my mouth was irritated. This was possibly from spicy food or acid reflux, and that it appeared to be possibly infected. After finally coming to and going to the ER, this was confirmed. I was given antibiotics and went home. I have since fully recuperated thankfully.","label":1}

{"text":"Two months ago, my daughter invited me over for Father's Day.  I was pretty excited because it was also my grandson's 5th birthday that day.  The whole family came over to her house.  The weather was perfect with a slight breeze.  My son in law barbecued chicken, burgers, and hot dogs for everyone.  Most of the family that attended brought side dishes.  Two cakes were presented after lunch.  One said Happy Father's Day and the other was Happy Birthday.  We blew the candles out on each together and laughed.  I had an amazing time watching my grandson open his gifts.  It never fails to amaze me the delight in a young child's eyes.  When evening hit, I knew it was time for me to get home before it got too dark out.  I hugged everyone.  When I said goodbye to my grandson, I thanked him for sharing his special day with me.  I wouldn't change this day for the world.","label":0}
{"text":"A woman came in late one evening to the hospital who was very obviously in labor. It was about 4 months ago but it was one of the most memorable events during clinical rotation that I've ever witnessed. The woman who was very heavily pregnant was with her partner waiting to check in. While her partner filled out paperwork and answered questions, the woman leaned against the wall for support. Finally and none too soon, the woman was rushed into an exam room where her water broke and chaos ensued. The on call doctor announced that woman was already crowning and that she was ready to deliver. There was no time to call others into the room. I stepped up and followed the orders given to me by the doctor. The woman who was ill prepared for natural childbirth, tried her best to push and push but you could tell she was exhausted. I did my best to comfort her and coach her through contractions. Not twenty minutes after the woman's arrival, her baby was born into a hastily set up exam room. I stayed with the woman and her partner and witnessed their first moments as a family until nurses arrived. This is the field that I have chosen to enter and witnessing my first birth really made me more sure of my decision. There's nothing like seeing a new life enter the world and seeing a family together for the first time. As I continue my training, I try to keep this event fresh in my memory as inspiration to keep going.","label":0}
{"text":"It was my best friends birthday party. We both turned 22 and we wanted to celebrate together. He invited all his friends and I brought some of my close friends and we all partied. That night I drank a ton of alcohol. I remember chugging a four loko and drinking a bottle of Hennessy by myself. After that I felt really drunk and was all over the place. I was definitely drunk because I remember being in the bathroom with my friends over the toilet trying to throw up. My girlfriend walked in gave me some bread to eat and I reluctantly accepted. After I ate the bread I threw up in the toilet and couldn't stop after that. I just kept going and going. After I cleaned myself up and went back out to keep partying. My friends were all super drunk and messed up but we all had a good time. I remember getting kicked out my friend's ex girlfriend because my friend was ready to knock out. We were on the street with a couple of my other friends. Before I could leave, I threw up one more time in a trash bag. It was really fun and even though I felt really bad the next morning I would love to do it again.","label":1}

{"text":"The surprise party for my mother-in-law was a big success. I can't believe how much work it was to get everything planned! I honestly did not believe that it would all work out. I had been worried about the guest list but it turned out that I invited everyone important to her. I was even able to get her sister and nieces into town for the big day. The look on her face when she saw her sister, who she hadn't seen in years, was priceless. Seeing her that happy really made me forget about all the stress the party had caused me. I am glad we decided to have it at her favorite restaurant too. The food was amazing. They made a custom menu for us and we were able to have all of my mother in laws favorite foods. The macaroni and cheese with bacon was my favorite. The chicken Parmesan was also very good. It felt really good to give her this party because of the terrible year she had. I can't imagine how hard losing her husband must have been. I just hope this party showed her how many people support her and love her.","label":0}

{"text":"My recent break-upLess than a month ago my girlfriend Heather broke up with me. This was very difficult for me because we had been pretty serious about eachother (we had plans for a life together) and I wasn't expecting it at all. I had to move all of my things out of the place we had together, I remember thinking at the time that it didn't feel real to me, I couldn't get my emotions to process and as a result I felt disoriented. Even weeks after the event I still think about it from time to time. I have a lot of regret, could I have done something different? Could things have worked out if I had put in more effort? I'm learning that sometimes we can do everything right and things still not work out in our favor. That's part of being human. So now I'm trying my best to not dwell on my past and to look forward to my own personal future. This future will be devoid of other people determining my value or worth and I'll set my own goals for what I think is right. I used to worry about growing old and alone. Now I worry more about growing old and not achieving the things that I've always wanted for myself. I'll focus now on becoming more independent and stable. I no longer seek company from people who want more than just my presence. I think I can be happy again.","label":1}

{"text":"I recently moved to Belgium to study abroad. I remember how scared I was the day that I went to the airport. My parents were crying, and even though I wanted to be strong, I bawled like a little baby. I felt sad to be leaving home, and scared about diving into the unknown. I didn't know anyone I would be living with. I didn't know the language, the customs, or the culture. I was confident in my ability to adapt, but how could I not be scared? I remember crying some more as the plane took off into the night. When I finally arrived, the next few days were some of the hardest I've ever had in my life. I felt alone, unsure of myself, and overwhelmed by the transition. My new room was big but felt empty. But after about a week or so, I met one of my roommates who had just moved in. We immediately hit it off and became friends. As I met more and more people, I began to feel less lonely and more and more at home. By the time I had to go home, I cried - but this time about leaving.","label":1}

{"text":"This event occurred about two weeks ago. I was going shopping for a birthday present with my little cousin(she's 8). So we went in, and spent about 45 minutes just browsing around the store, trying to pick a toy that she would like. My little cousin wasn't sure which toy to pick, but I told her that it couldn't be more than 20 dollars. However, she insisted that she wanted this miniature action figure that was well beyond the price range we had agreed on. When I firmly told her no, she began throwing the biggest tantrum I had ever witnessed. She was crying her lungs out, and no matter what I did, there was no quieting her. Given that I detest when children do this, I forcefully grabbed her by her wrists and got her out of the store empty handed. Not only did she not get the toy she wanted, but I told her that she could forget about getting anything else. She looked at me with eyes of rage, and just stopped talking to me for a few days after that. My aunt wasn't particularly happy with the situation but she took my side that it was the best thing that I could've done. That doesn't mean that I felt happy by the outcome, but I think teaching kids at early age that throwing fits like those are not going to solve problems. A few days before her birthday, I went and had a serious talk with her explaining how what she did was wrong. She eventually apologized, and told her that if she still wanted a toy. She ended up just going for ice cream, saying that she didn't want anything else. Fortunately, her birthday was a success, and seemed quite happy for having all her family and friends with her. I did ended up buying her that toy that she wanted because I think she showed maturity when she apologized for what she did, and wanted to reward her for that.","label":1}

The competition was running hot and cold among the normally tight group. Everything was ready to go.  I was at the top of the ladder trying to fasten hardware and I couldn't reach the roof!  So now I have to wait for Missy to come home from work. When she does I will ask if her husband is available to carry their heavy ladder over.  They could easily sabotage my entry.  I hope they are \"available\".  I hope they do not delay.  I can't get the decorations up in time before the deadline if they play games.  Thank goodness our neighborhood is not mean spirited.

{"text":"I wasn't feeling well for a few weeks.  I just shrugged it off and went on with everyday life.  That is, until the pain became too much and was interferring with my life.  I went to emergency room and had a few tests ran.  They also did a sonogram on my leg to see if they could figure out what was causing the pain.  Once they got the results, I was informed that I had a blood clot in the main artery in my leg.  I was immediately admitted to the hospital and started on an i.v. to thin my blood.  I was confined to the bed for a week to make sure that the clot did not move.  The damage to my leg was severe.  It looked like major road construction had been done on my veins.  I also had to learn to walk on that leg again.  I couldn't do the normal things I had before this happened.  I had to be careful not to cut or bruise myself while on blood thinners.  This was not easy as I have a grandchild to take care of during the day.  It sucks learning to live differently that I had been, all because of a stupid blood clot.  I'm ready to be normal again.","label":1}

{"text":"August 7th, 2019. I have just moved all my belongings from the motel into my new apartment. The nightmare is over. It is a new day now and I can get on with my life. Granted, I still have a lot of stuff in a storage locker and I need to find another job, but I don't have to deal with all the issues of that last house anymore. I will have to put more thought into how I choose roommates in the future. It started out pretty good. I was in school and everyone was pulling their weight. It didn't take long though for my younger roommates to not be reliable for rent and utilities. That kind of stuff reflects badly on me. Additionally they were very messy. Dirty clothes draped over furniture and stacks of dirty dishes was the norm. The smell would get badly sometimes. My girlfriend noticed it and it was awkward. I am so glad I know how to clean up after myself and these issues won't be a problem anymore. It might be more expensive for this single apartment but I am thankful. My cats seem to like it but they probably also miss the backyard of the last place. It was a wonderful house, I just wish they took better care of it. I certainly tried to.","label":1}
{"text":"About three months ago I started going to see a therapist. I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, \"that was a long time ago, get over it\". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session. That I don't need to hold onto those any longer. I can let them go. They no longer have the power to affect me. Easily the most memorable experience that I've had this year.","label":1}

{"text":"My wife and I adopted a dog a few months ago. We first saw him when she saw a post on Facebook from the local animal shelter. She sent me a picture of the dog. He was very thin and looked very sad. We both felt very sorry for the dog. My wife saw the dog a week after we had moved into a new house. We had talked about getting another dog after we moved but ultimately decided against it. Our older dog is jealous of attention given to other dogs. We thought that he would be happier as an only dog. So when we first saw the dog at the shelter we talked about donating money to his care if he was picked up by a rescue group. However a few hours later neither of us could stop thinking about him. We called the shelter and were told that the dog needed more care than they could provide and that he wouldn't be kept there any longer. We decided that we had to go pick him up. We took the dog to a vet. They determined that he would need a blood transfusion but that it should wait until the following morning as the vet wasn't sure if he would survive the night. The next day the dog was given a blood transfusion. We were then able to take him home a few days later. We named him Pablo. Several months later he has gained weight and is more than twice the weight he was when we got him. He rather quickly adjusted to living with humans and has learned to use the bathroom outside. He is friendly and loving. Though he does still bite occasionally and is scared of strangers.","label":1}

{"text":"About 3 months or so ago a friend and I took a day trip to a local big cat sanctuary. It was a hot afternoon with a bit of a gust, but otherwise it was pleasant. We weren't sure if the cats would be active or not, but to our surprise some were! The most memorable part for me was the first exhibit, which was a cheetah. The cheetah was lying down on the opposite side of the enclosure, but when it saw us coming it walked right up to all of us and started purring like a house cat! We all took videos and pictures and the animal was just hamming it up for the camera, it was a lot of fun! I'm a big animal lover, especially cats, so this experience really moved me and made me feel happy. Before this trip I didn't know cheetahs could purr! A lot of the other cats were pretty laid back that day, but a few were active. We got to see a rare sand cat, as well as jaguars and snow leapords! They even had a white bengal tiger, she was so beautiful and had ice blue eyes. We plan to go back again soon. Seeing all the big cats so up close and personal made me feel very connected to nature and happy. Everyone had a wonderful time and learned quite a bit about the big cats we all saw! My favorites were the cheetah and bengal tiger.","label":1}
{"text":"After standing in line, we went on the Harry Potter ride around 2 p.m. that Saturday.  The experience was truly epic!  We both relished the opportunity to experience the new ride.  I would recommend this ride to anyone who really likes Harry Potter movies and books.  In fact, I would offer that the uninitiated would enjoy the ride, too.  In other words, even if you are not a Harry Potter aficionado, you would likely enjoy this experience.  We have gone to all the Harry Potter movies and have every one of J.K. Rowling's books.  After enjoying the ride, we ate an early dinner and had spaghetti and pizza at the theme park's outdoor cafe.  While more expensive than usual fast casual restaurants, the spaghetti was delicious and complete with Italian meatballs spiced to perfection.  Compliments to the chef, indeed!!!  Despite paying the rather hefty $15 for parking, we were still enthused about the whole experience.  The theme park also has wonderful static displays, as well as video monitors, of the entire Harry Potter experience.  In fact, I heard via word-of-mouth that the theme park could have another Harry Potter ride in the future.  This would be a true delight for all people who like things related to Harry Porter and his cast of characters.  It is also rumored that Rowling may have another book lined up as well for her fans.","label":0}
{"text":"About 4 months ago my brother got married to his now wife Lauren. At their wedding, I was the best man. As the best man, I was in charge of giving the best man speech. I was also in charge of throwing him a bachelor party. For his bachelor party I took him and a few friends to the city to a restaurant. Afterwards we went to a bar and all got hammered. Finally we ended up staying in a 5 star hotel for the night. His wedding was about 2 weeks after his bachelor party. This event was amazing and memorable and I will probably remember it forever. There were more than 200 people in attendance, and great music, dancing, and all around atmosphere. Most importantly, they was making a commitment that was beautiful to witness, and made me feel a certain way that I had never really understood or felt, and still do not fully get. I think what I felt was some weird love that my brother was now going to be living and moving forward with his life with someone else, and it almost felt like I was losing my brother. When it came time to give the best man speech, I had not actually written one. I basically just winged it and made it up as I went along. Surprisingly, it actually went great and everyone loved the stories that I told from us growing up and how he always looked out for me and that he would make a great husband. He always treated me with care and showed me love as a brother, so I knew that he would take care of his wife.

{"text":"My daughter moved into a small house on my property. This event happened two weeks ago. I am very happy about it and have done a lot to help this work out for her. My daughter is out of college with a career as a massage therapist for cancer patients. She is just getting going in her career and so doesn't have much money saved. She has found a boyfriend she likes and he is going to live in her house as well. This directly involves me because I worked out the plan for her to come live here. I helped her with her credit and helped her physically move her furniture. Most importantly I helped her decide it was the right thing to do, to live next to her mother and younger sister. The reason this is my story, is because I have recently been diagnosed with lung cancer. This is terrifying to me because I might die. It is also scary because my wife is a stay at home mother with our vaccine injured daughter. I have no life insurance because I am a smoker. If I do die, my daughter will need her sister and mother to help finish raising her. Family is everything and I know my wife will need the support emotionally, of her older daughter, if I die and leave her alone. This is devastating for the entire family. Arranging to have my older daughter live nearby gives me great comfort in these dark days.","label":1}

{"text":"My sister gave me $800 to buy a birthday gift for husband, because she works so much and is unable to go out shopping.  Plus the fact she's not sure what kind of gift he would like.  Since her husband and I talk about a lot of things and we have so much in common, she thought it be best if I pick out the gift. The day she gave me the money, I had put it in my wallet, and left my wallet sitting on my dresser.  That same night, a friend of mine had come over, saying he wanted to talk.  He's been having financial problems lately do to the fact that he has gotten addicted to pain medication.  He came over, and we talked for quite some time.  He said he needed to use the bathroom, which is located next to my room, I only have one bathroom.  As he went into the bathroom, he saw my wallet sitting on my dresser, which is located near my bedroom door, which you can clearly see as you go into the bathroom.  He went into my room, got into my wallet and took the money, then went into the bathroom.  After he was done, he suddenly said he had forgotten something he had to do, and had to leave.  We talked for about 2-3 minutes more, and he left.  After he left, I finished a few things around the house that I needed to do and finally went to my bedroom.  As I was getting ready for bed, I noticed that my wallet was not in the same spot that I had placed it earlier.  I opened it and saw that the $800 was gone.  I was furious and hurt.  I tried calling my friend, but he never answered.  I went to bed angry and hurt.  The next day, I tried calling my friend again, and no answer.  I thought about calling the police, but decided not to.  I realized  that I will have to pay for my sister's husband gift myself.  So I went looking for the gift, found a nice tablet that he would like, and paid for it on my credit card.  I never told my sister what happened, and am no longer friends with the friend who stole the money.","label":0}
{"text":"Two months ago my best friend and I got into a huge fight. I thought it would blow over, but we haven't spoken since. I had to finally come clean about something that had been bothering me for awhile. There was this guy that she had just started dating. He seemed nice enough at first. But then I started looking around on the internet. I found him connected to a couple of really sketchy dating profiles. He was saying things that didn't seem to match the way that he portrayed himself with her. She had met him at a bar, so she had no idea about any of this. She didn't even have a profile on any dating apps. I thought about the situation for a couple of weeks. I also asked for advice from some mutual friends. Eventually I couldn't really avoid the situation any longer because I didn't want her to get hurt. She had really started to like this guy. I invited her out for drinks, and then I told her what I had found. She listened pretty patiently, but then she exploded on me. She didn't understand why I needed to bring this up. She said that maybe he had changed, and these were old profiles. She said maybe people are different on the internet sometimes. I don't know. I guess I need to try to talk to her again, but she seems to be choosing him over me.","label":0}

I was greatful that she had made it through surgery.  It was quite tricky fusing the upper three vertebrae of the spinal column.  She smiled through the pain very heroically.  She was glad to be going home but no one was happier than I was.  I was afraid of loosing her and concious of the long struggle we both had ahead during the looming recovery.  I knew I was going to be her main caretaker.  I would  have to run the house while she was in recovery.   I was not slightly intimidated by the prospect.  I drove home watching her wince at every bump in the road inher reaction to the pain.  I looked at the situation as another chance to excell.  We have been together for 45 years and I want our time to never end.  I called her family and informed them of her return home and asked them to call later to offer their support.

The food there was top notch. I had Texan barbeque and it was the best meat i've ever tasted. Everyone recommended the brisket which was what i got. The meat was very tender and fell right off the bone. After eating, i spend a lot of time just sight seeing. We went to the capital and it was beautiful inside. I even got to ride a Lime scooter. It was a bit scary though because i was riding without a helmet. I also didn't know the scooter rules so i just rode on the street with the cars which made it even scarier.","label":1}

I was expected to speak at his service and I didn't know what to do because I hadn't stopped crying since I got the phone call that he had unexpectedly passed away. I searched my heart and my brain to find something to say but for the life of me I couldn't stop crying long enough to get anything out onto paper much less anything that I could get up in front of everyone and say. I just decided that I would go with the flow and try to come up with what to say on the spot. That was a disaster. From the minute I walked up to the podium I started crying and could barely get a word out in between sobs. Once I got calmed down a bit I tried to talk about all the good times and memories that I had with my father and I got a few out before I had to take a break. I told about the times when we used to go riding around in his mustang and the time he let me move it in my grandmother's driveway and freaked out because he thought I was gonna hit that big tree. I talked about how much he loved his grandkids and how he would take them fishing and teach them how to work on cars. I talked about how he put off his retirement for years and we all knew it was because he loved his job regardless of how much he claimed to hate it. I knew he would be proud of me for standing up in front of everyone talking like that. He knew I had terrible anxiety but I was glad I was able to control it long enough to talk about him and what he meant to me. When I finally said everything I was able to say I went back to my seat where I collapsed into my mother's arms and cried for the rest of the service.","label":0}

{"text":"I recently was able to go to an amazing concert. I have always loved live music and dreamed of going to a John Mayer concert, and I was able to finally. After years of listening to his music, the perfect moment had come. I didn't have work, I had enough money saved, the universe had opened this opportunity up for me. When I found out he was going on tour, I immediately went to look at ticket prices. I knew that his shows would sell out quickly, and the prices would skyrocket. With some luck, and haste, I was able to secure tickets for the show. During the night of the event, the venue was very crowded. My friend and I found our seats which were very nice, and somewhat close to the stage. There was no opening act because John Mayer had wanted it this way so he had more time to perform this tour. My friend and I were talking to each other beforehand in anticipation. And then suddenly we were interrupted by the sound of guitar. The show had begun. John Mayer came out on the stage opening the show up with one of his most iconic songs, gravity. I surprised myself with tears in my eyes. I didn't realize how emotional his music made me feel until that moment. His opening number was definitely the most memorable moment of the show for me. I think it is because the anticipation I had, finally came to fruition. Ever since I was a child, I had listened to John Mayer. I recall my mother driving me to school playing him on the speakers while I sat in the back seat. This was definitely the best concert I had ever been to. I will never forget it.","label":1}

{"text":"A very close friend of mine and her 4 month old son had been living with me for a few weeks  I love\/d her very much, for a very long time and had attempted to date for many times over the years  The reason they had moved in with me, was because of her husband's  inability to control his habits.  He had locked her and her son out of there home with only the clothes they had on at the time.  He refused to allow her in the house to grab anything for any reason, including formula . While she was living with me.  I allowed her to do whatever, whenever she wanted to do it.  I hadn't seen her for a few months prior to this  My friend was so happy to be a mother again.  You could see it on her face and she spent so much time with her son day and night.  It was very heart-warming.  He is a very good baby and she didn't hesitate to retrieve him upon him waking up from a nap.   I worried\/warned her of the spoiling and that it may result in habits harder to break for both of them in the future     Slowly she had allowed the responsibilities to be shared with me involving feeding and caring for her son.  Assistance she claimed she never had with her her husband before.   I was happy to help and offer her assistance, not only because I still wished to date her, but because none of my children live with me any longer and it was a great reminisce time for myself.   As I had stated earlier, I allowed her to come and go as she pleased and I never told her what to do or set any rules what-so-ever for her.  This resulted in her having freedom she had not had for awhile.  Self-control is not in the top 10 best traits that she possesses and she over indulged herself to say the least.  She started to seek 'the party life' versus 'the stay at home mom life' that she had been for x amount of time.   Her son, although easy for me to handle and never was a direct issue, had started to miss his mom as much as he had her prior.   She was very capable and she never neglected her son in anyway.  However, I had said to her soon as I started to notice the change in degree of quality care she was giving him, compared to when she first got here.      She had stopped holding him while he drank from a bottle and started propping it up everytime.  I ad originally commented on how amazed I was about him not addicted to a pacifier and she expressed her worry of dental problems if she got him one.  Suddenly she had boughten him and got frustrated with him because wasn't seeming to want the pacifier she gave him.  So I had pointed out to her these changes I noticed that had been undesirable.  She argued with me, denied the possibility, accused my reasons for ulterior motivations and started to very obviously disrespect me at any given time.   So, after a few days of this I had no choice but to ask her to leave.   The moment after I asked her to she left and returned that evening with her husband to retrieve her belongings.","label":1}

We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive to late at night because we would have been tired. We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us.

It was the first time I had met him and seen him in real life so I was really looking forward to it. He made me feel good and cared for for so many years before we actually met. I remember seeing him standing outside the airport waiting for me. He looked a little sad and scared, but I knew that he loved me and I immediately felt safe with him and like I could breathe for the first time. We spent a week or so together at my farm before driving back to his place, a 10 hour drive, where I stayed for a month. I got to visit all sorts of new places and we did a lot of fun things together. I remember that being with him and at his place, was the best that I had ever slept in many months. It was like he and I belonged together, and for once I felt like I was with someone who could handle things and didn't need me to do it all. It was the best I had felt in my life in a really long time. He made me feel adored and loved. He made me feel really special and talked in ways about the two of us that no one even did before.

It was an important event for me, and I had to do a lot of preparation. First off, I had to find the venue. I looked all over town for various options, and made a list of the best choices. Then, our group voted on which restaurant to choose. We ended up choosing Anju, a new Korean place which had rave reviews. Next, I locked down the reservations, and made sure everybody knew when it was happening. However, we made sure to keep it a secret from Pablo, in hopes of surprising him. Once the night of the dinner arrived, I went over to Pablo's apartment to pick him up. He was a bit confused on what we were doing, but I told him we would go grab a slice of pizza or something. As we arrived at the Korean restaurant, Pablo begin to suspect that something was up. As soon as he seen all of our friends waiting outside, he knew he had been surprised. Everybody jumped out and yelled \"surprise\" in unison. It was really well done, and Pablo was laughing so hard he began to cry. We filed into the restaurant, and began our meal. We had a lot of laughs, told a lot of stories, and ate our fair share of delicious Korean cuisine. As we finished our main course, the staff came out with another surprise - a large chocolate cake, with \"goodbye Pablo\" spelled out in white icing. It looked amazing!

{"text":"I rent a large 4 bedroom home with my fiance, and our three children. About 3 years ago we let one of my fiance's friends he's had since high school stay with us. There was no bedroom available, so he made a room for himself out of furniture and bedsheets in the large 'man cave' that is adjacent to the living room. I was slightly apprehensive about it because I knew he was a little moody at times, but agreed because he was our friend and would be paying us $200 in rent per month. For the first year or so things were going nicely, we were all happy (as far as I know), and friendly. Spending time together, helping each other out when needed, etc. But as time went on, our friend\/roommate became more miserable. His job started early, so he wanted to come home and take naps at 3-4 in the afternoon, and that is a difficult thing to do when you are in a room made out of sheets, and there are two toddler boys in the next room. Also, the boys and I are always home, because I cannot drive, we live on a highway so it's not safe to walk anywhere, and my fiance is always at work, so it was like this every day. I don't work because daycare in the area I live for 2 toddlers cost more than what I made at my job! So this was happening every day. In addition to that, our friends would come over and stay late, and they were his friends too. Usually 1 to 2 times per week. So I guess he wasn't getting enough sleep. I say I guess, because this man, in addition to being moody, is very passive aggressive. So instead of talking to us about his issues, he would just walk by in silence, ignore me if I said hello to him, and just generally be bitter. He wasn't like that all the time though. Sometimes he would be like that, and just a few hours later be kind and talkative. So over time, he became more and more bitter and confusing, helping us out like friends less and less, and isolating himself more and more. And was friendly mostly when he was drunk. Eventually he started blaming me for my children being loud in the day, and even telling them to shut the f--- up sometimes! So about two weeks ago the situation came to its head, and my fiance had it. He told him that he has been mean to us and our children, a bad friend, and that he needs to move out. It is sad, because they have been friends since they were 15, and I know he will hold animosity towards us. I feel bad for him though, because he always has these kinds of problems with people.","label":1}

I give it to you God.  I pray the facility treats her well. I promise I will go check on her everyday. I wonder sometimes if I did the right thing. I could have tried to at least try and see if she could live with me for a while. But my apartment is so small. I truly believe she will do fine once she settles into the place. I feel truly guilty.

This is the hardest part because I had to ride my motorcycle around some obstacles. Getting on and finishing my turn was scary. I was the fifth one out of ten people that Saturday morning. Thanks to Governer Newsom, I was able to complete my test on a Saturday instead of taking time off work. This test looks easy, but getting on the bike and actually doing it is a whole nother story. But I did it! I passed that little DMV obstacle couse, finished my turn and got my motorcycle license!

{"text":"In August of 2019 I visited friends in detroit. They were friends that I've had for several years, but this was the first time we would be meeting in person. We met playing League of Legends online, and we are all fans of the professional scene of that game as well. So when finals were going to be hosted in Detroit it seemed like a perfect time to visit both my friends, and also go see this event I've loved so much live. We went to Little Ceasers arena and got to watch one of our favorite teams battle it out against the top team in North America. I don't go to a lot of sporting events so it was novel for me to get swept up in a cheering crowd or scream when something awesome happened on stage. Unfortunately they lost but the games were close. My favorite moment was getting to hear one of my favorite songs live and hear the stadium hum and sing along to it. Although a close second was getting to go backstage. We didn't get to meet any of the professional players, but we got to meet the tour manager. Backstage was amazing to see, they basically had to set up a whole home office just for a weekend. Besides just the event, I got to play games with my friends in person and hang out in their houses, and I loved every moment of it. I also brought my dog with because I talk to him constantly while I'm in a call with my friends so it felt right that they would finally get to meet him. The drive there and back was long, about 12 hours both ways. But I didn't mind it because I listened to podcasts the whole way. I did make the mistake of listening to a murder podcast just as it was getting dark, so that actually did make me a little anxious.","label":1}

We did not make any plans, but we stick to follow the Pacific Coast Highway. During the trip we stopped at many cool locations, including a coffee place where my friend met a girl who was also doing a road trip. However, she was alone and did not had a car, as she was mostly relying on rides. We offered her to join us on the rest of the trip, which she promptly accepted. We continued our journey visiting many small places and seeing very nice landscapes. During the trip, the new girl and my friend started to flirt with each other. One or two days later they starting to date. Once we arrived in Los Angeles, they booked a separated room for them. Later on, we found out that the girl was from San Francisco as well. We then came back to our town, but this time we flew. The girl came with us. Looking back to the road trip, it was a very pleasant experience for me and especially for my friend. My friend is still dating the girl we met in the trip. In fact, I think he is about to propose to her.

{"text":"About two months ago, I did not have a job because I had just graduated. I was used to working part-time jobs, and was not making that much. At the time, I was very depressed and stressed about my financial situation because I was in debt, broke, and had over $200,000 worth of student loans. I was at the end of my road because I was waking up extremely sad every day and I felt like I had nothing to live for. I was discouraged because I had been applying for jobs for months prior to graduating but everyone said i was applying too early and that I needed more experience. The longer I was unemployed the more depressed I had gotten. At this point, I was losing so much weight I was down to about 90 pounds and my appetite was pretty much non-existent. I decided that I needed to do something because I felt myself going to a very dark place that was scary to think about and I felt like I was going to end up doing something irrational that I would regret. I needed help but didn't want to ask anyone for help. I decided that I needed to get up and get my life together. One particular morning I woke up and applied to at least 30 jobs in one day. I was determined to find a job because I knew that would solve at least some of my problems. It would provide me with a stable full-time salary so I would be able to take care of some of my debt and other financial obligations. The next day, I decided that I needed to talk to someone, so I called a help hotline. I was on the phone with a specialist for about an hour and a half and she was able to help me feel better. The specialist boosted my confidence and gave me some tools that I could use next time I was feeling depressed or stressed. About a week later, I got called for an interview that I was really interested in. I ended up getting hired the same day, right after my interview which was really exciting and motivated me to do better.","label":1}

All the problems and choices I would have to make after graduation slipped from my mind because I was so excited. There were a lot of people at the ceremony and I was just one of many waiting to get their diploma. After the speeches the dean started calling names in alphabetical order. I nervously waited my turn since I was always anxious about appearing on stage, even if it was just to grab a piece of paper. My name was called and as smoothly as I could walked up and onto the stage. After shaking a few hands and grabbing my diploma I started to walk to the other side of the stage. My foot must have caught my robe in a weird way and I fell forward while walking. The crowd gasped as I quickly picked myself up and briskly walked off the stage. Thankfully the ceremony went on as normal and I think most people forgot what happened pretty quickly. I was and to a degree still am embarrassed by what happened. It didn't help that my family joked about it during the after party and dinner. I realized though that it wasn't nearly as bad as it felt when it happened. That over time this would become a funny story to share with friends.","label":0}

{"text":"It was three weeks ago that I set out on my personal mission to test my fortitude. I cut out things in my life that were holding me back, making me negative, or were not conducive to being my best self. I gave myself one month to go without social media, lustful thoughts, cussing, television, and sweets. It's definitely been a challenge! Since most people are on a health kick after the New Year, giving up sweets has been relatively easy, though I do sometimes miss having something sweet after dinner. Losing a few pounds has encouraged me to stick with the sweet dessert abstinence. The hardest thing has been giving up television. I have felt very out of touch with what's going on in the world. I also miss some of my favorite shows and find myself wondering if I will have trouble following the story arc once I start watching again. Social media has been surprisingly easy to give up. I guess that's because the negativity on there was really getting to me. I don't miss the drama or the rudeness. I have also found that by focusing my thoughts more positively and not swearing, cussing, or thinking lustful thoughts, I have more energy for creative thoughts. I've written two new poems and have a new story idea to write! Overall, the experience has been very rewarding. It's made me feel stronger as a person and has proven my willpower and faith.","label":0}

After running around with her for about 15  minutes, I noticed that Pips slowing down. She took a couple of breaks before quitting and sat down for a rest. Now this was a little odd because Pips has been an active dog since a pup. I call Pips up and tell her to fetch me her favorite toy bunny. After looking at me and the her toy she gets up slowly, I notice that she's arching her back in a weird way and limps to the toy. At that moment, I could have kicked myself because that wasn't my dog. Pips was hurting and my guilt rose quickly because being her momma, I should have noticed it as soon as she sat down the first time. But Pips being the people pleaser she was, obeyed my command. It was that moment when I made a call to our Vet where I was told to bring Pips first thing in the morning. When we arrived at the vet, the Doctor did the usual checks and vitals. The doctor claimed it was some kind of back injury and prescribed Pips some pain meds and suggested some weird exercises and stretches to do with her. I was told that the I would be called for a follow up soon.  It's been 4 weeks and no calls or answers from the doctor. Pips has lost weight and the pain meds have ran out. I tried the exercises and Pips howls out in pain! We can't sleep and I cannot bare to see Pips in pain anymore! I have to carry her everywhere and I have already missed too many days at work! I am currently looking for another vet I can trust. If I don't, I have no clue what will happen to Pips. I just want her to be okay so I can have my silly, hyper puppy back.","label":0}

I am very proud of my accomplishment and where I have come. The event that I am describing is my first direct experience being a political candidate in a local election. I experienced all sections of the process from getting my name on the ballot, to fundraising, to strategy, etc. While there were many memorable parts in retrospective thinking, the most memorable part was when we figured out I was the first in my political party to hold the particular office when I was elected, the first female in history and the youngest to ever be elected to the position. This is significant to me because of the struggles to prove myself to my community and my generation. There were a lot of uphill battles to prove my work ethic and my desire to serve. I am reminded daily of this event by going to work and continuing my service to my constituents. I am constantly reminded by the hurdles I overcame by being a single female on the ballot.

{"text":"It was a warm winter day in the interior of Alaska with the sun shining brighter than  it has in months.  I harnessed up 11 out of the 12 dogs i had to the sled and hit the trail.  The trail was extremely fast considering the sun was melting the hard packed snow and freezing it over night.  We took off on our normal training run and the dogs were extremely focused.  I had my go-pro rolling since the day was so beautiful and i wanted to capture the openness of crossing the river on such a bright day.  We ran without a break until we got to the river and i could tell the dogs were getting tired.  We took a break right before the downhill to cross the river and when i looked up i noticed a moose just across the bank.  The dogs were so tired they didn't even notice, the more i watched this big cow moose eat off the trees i noticed a calf emerge from the woods behind her.  I watched in amazement as i always did when i saw moose, now was my chance to be quiet and watch because they hadn't seen me yet.  While i was watching the moose i heard a scream not too far off which sounded like a cat, and indeed it was.  Only 45-50 yards away from the moose was a full grown lynx walking the bank of the river.  Lynx are extremely rare to see in the wild and i was excited.  I couldn't believe that the dogs had not made a sound at this point, but they typically didn't during a needed rest.  Just when i thought this free nature show couldn't get any better a second lynx walked out from the woods and began a mating call with the first lynx.  I listened to them and watched them walk the bank for what seemed like and hour.  I have never seen anything so great and beautiful from nature and probably never will.  Soon as the lynx and moose were out of my site i commanded the dogs to hit the trail and continue the run.  I am very thankful for this day in Alaska as a dog musher.","label":1}

I knew it happened, but somehow I never really thought too much about it. About 2 weeks ago now, I was walking down the road on my way to get a cup of coffee before doing some Christmas shopping and I saw a bunch of businesses with people curled up outside them. Trying to keep themselves warm with blankets, sleeping bags and hats. Those were the lucky ones. I saw ones that were just huddled up inside doorways doing their best to stay warm and alive with empty cups in front of them, or signs. Just begging people to help them out with the basic needs that every human being needs and deserves. I don't know what it was that made me notice today of all days. Maybe because I was out spending too much money on Christmas presents that really weren't that needed when there are people who can't even afford a hot meal. I spotted one guy sitting there with just a small blanket, though he wasn't using the blanket, the blanket was curled around a small dog, who looked as though he had seen better days. I dug into my pockets and checked what I had for cash, and it wasn't much. I stopped to talk to him, and learned he had been laid off 2 years ago and lost his home and has no family near by. I talked to him for a bit learning that he found the dog abandoned one day and decided to keep him. His money that he gets from panhandling goes to feeding his dog, who is his best friend. I asked him if he was hungry and he looked at me quite surprised and said he was starving, he was lucky to eat at all each day. He asked a friend of his a few feet away to watch his dog, and off we went to get some lunch. I picked up some sandwiches for the others that I spotted and some hot cups of coffee, and of course a bag of dog food for his buddy. We delivered the food, and I've never seen such joy before. It was a good moment, I made a lot of people happy, but most of all, I made myself happy.","label":0}

Illegal migrants circumvent the legal system for their own convenience and self gratification, generally to engage in illegal activities, which include drug trafficking, human trafficking, voter fraud, organized criminal activities, ID fraud, random criminal activities, welfare fraud, and a huge burden on the tax support structure of the country they invade.","label":1}

{"text":"In May, my boyfriend's mother got news that she was very ill. She went to the doctor's to get cleared for a hip surgery, and they did some sort of stress test and found that she had some arterial blockages. She went for further testing, and they found that she needed to choose between having open heart surgery to clear the blockages or put stents in to improve the situation. This news impacted me because it really impacted my boyfriend, and made me think about when my dad was sick a few years ago. His mother didn't want to have surgery, and said that if it was her time to go, it was her time to go. She eventually (July) chose to have the stents put in, and went to a second doctor's appointment, where the information was relayed... and they basically told my boyfriend, his sister, myself and his mother that there was a good chance she'd have a stroke on the operating table based on the initial results. To make a long story short, she still went in for the surgery at the end of August, but when they put the scope in for the stents, they found that there was no blockage as described - and that she didn't need to have the surgery. The doctor was astounded at how different the truth was from what was shown on the initial testing. This impacted me again because it meant that we'd been worrying for months about nothing. It made me realize that getting a second opinion is always necessary, because sometimes even medical professionals can make mistakes - that result in unnecessary worries for people for months, as well as end of life planning that doesn't need to be done. It made me scared, it made me sad, and it made me mad. I we were preparing for the worst for nearly 3 months, and it turned out that none of it was necessary. I'm always going to think about this when I go in for medical procedures and appointments now. Medical professionals might be able to help a lot of people, but in this case, they didn't at all. His mom was just stressed for months, the whole family was stressed, and it was what we thought was a race against time - even though it wasn't.","label":1}
{"text":"Three months ago I was driving my trailer to my friend's house when suddenly I felt awful pain in my stomach. I felt like I was dying. I had never felt pain like this before. It came from nowhere. I thought it would pass. It never did. So I drove to the hospital. I didn't have anywhere to put my trailer, and the hospital had a service where they put  your trailer in a free camp spot. It was such a hassle that it honestly was not worth it. The security did such a bad job that I can't believe I owe the hospital money after that. They totally ruined my trailer. It was completely dented and banged up. Anyway, it turns out my appendix burst. I had surgery and had it removed. Ultimately, it wasn't that serious. I am still mad about the trailer though.","label":0}

{"text":"I was looking forward to being able to spend time with my nephew.  My brother and I are very close and when he got married I was really happy for him because his wife is a wonderful person.  I knew they'd be great parents, like ours were, so it was with great excitement and anticipation that I accepted their offer to babysit for them while they took a much needed week-long break from work and parenting.  My brother doesn't live far away, so I drove down in my car, which I figured would be good anyway for getting around and taking my nephew for walks in the park.  When I arrived, my brother and his wife were very excited to see me!  They were nearly bubbling over with enthusiasm for my arrival.  I mean, I knew we were close, but this was unusual, even for them.  It should have tipped me off that something wasn't quite right.  My nephew was taking a nap at the time and it gave us a chance to go over all of the things I needed to know to take care of him.  There was a lot to learn!  Much more than I had anticipated.  There were the bottles, and the cleaning and the feedings and the medications and what to do if he's crying.  That was when I should have known what was up.  It turned out that my nephew had a very bad case of colic, and had been so for some months.  He was only 9 months old at the time, but man did he have a set of lungs on him.  I don't know if you've ever cared for a baby that has colic, but boy can they be loud.   My brother and his wife gathered their things, thanked me and hugged me and pretty much ran out the door.  From the moment the door closed it seemed like my nephew never stopped crying!  I tried everything to get him to stop, from feeding, to playing to rocking him.  It was pretty much non-stop crying - and now I knew why they had looked the way they did.  In the end, I discovered a great tactic for calming the crying.  It seems my nephew loved to ride in my car!  So, whenever the crying got too much, even in the middle of the night, I just loaded him in the car and drove around the block a few times.  That did the trick!  I was never so happy to see someone than I was when my brother returned from their vacation.","label":0}
{"text":"My son found a newborn kitten, abandoned by its mother.  He watched to be certain that the mother didn't come back.  When she didn't, he brought in the kitten.  After a family discussion, we decided to do what we could to save it. We all began to take care of  it.  The kitten was no more than a day old.  I watched as my children fed, cleaned and provided around the clock care for it.  My husband and I did the online research for them and assisted when needed, but my kids did the most of 24\/7 the hands-on care.  The most stressful was trying to be patient as the kitten learned to drink from a bottle and not fight.  The most difficult was having to stimulate the kitten to eliminate.  The burping after feeding was probably the cutest! What makes this so memorable, is that it was so moving be a part of this and to watch them save this baby kitten.  My husband and I are so proud of them. It's wonderful to have helped with saving this tiny baby's life.  The kitten is now a member of our family, and is thriving!","label":1}

At first I didn't want to say yes, but then I remember that I lost them in the first place. And I thought that maybe these new people should have a chance in keeping them. After all they found my cats, and kept them well fed and everything. So in the end, I said yes.","label":0}

I did not have a lot of money to spend, so I had to look carefully.  I may be a woman, but we are both riders, so I know a thing or two about them.

This will be a good project for us to over the winter months, to get it ready for him to ride it on the tracks next year!  It needs some cosmetic work done mainly, and a little more mechanically.  We had to buy tires immediately so that he could ride it and see what he needed to do to it, to make him happy with it.  We will be able to go different tracks in a couple of different states next year, and that is very exciting!

When we entered the casino, and that unforgettable scent of stale cigarette smoke and spilled booze hit me in the nose, those siren sounds of the slot machines caressed my eardrums, and the highly oxygenated air filled my lungs, I felt like today was going to be my day.

{"text":"My son recently became an Eagle Scout. His Eagle Scout ceremony was one that was very emotional and made me very proud. To see him up there, in front of many of our friends and family, giving a speech on what it means to be an Eagle Scout and how the journey to Eagle had made him the person he is brought tears to my eyes. He was very confident in his speaking, yet you could hear the crack of emotion when he mentioned certain people. You could tell that not only did his accomplishment mean a lot to him. But so did all the people who helped him along the way. As I sat there listening to him, I could not help but to think of the entire journey. It started when he was 6 years old as a Cub Scout. I was reminded of how hard he worked and how many fun times we shared on campouts and doing other activities related to Scouting. And I was so happy to have had the opportunity to share such moments with him. I also though of how proud I am that he is my son and also my best friend. He makes me a better person everyday through his behavior and the things that he does. I could not have asked for a better kid and I am so happy he has grown into the man he has. At one point during the ceremony, I looked around at everyone else who was there. I could tell he'd had a similar effect on them as well. They were proud of him and how hard he'd worked. They were also proud to know and that was perhaps the most heartwarming thing of all. To see others crying and sharing in the joy of his accomplishments was pretty amazing. It's something all parents should experience. It's a validation of sorts, and parents needs that, I think. Parenting is such a hard thing.

I had been involved in an online forum for video games, which I love, and started communicating to a few people regularly.  One of them was a girl around my same age who seemed to have similar tastes in games and other things.  We started chatting more and more and eventually it seemed like things were developing into romantic interest.  I've never been really good at that type of thing, so I was reluctant to pursue it in any way.  Besides, emotional connections are easy to elicit online.  Feeling \"warm and fuzzies\" about someone online, just based on their writing and the created image you have of them, isn't the basis of real love or connection.  It's very artificial.  Nonetheless, after spending more and more time online with her, sometimes hours per day, Skyping, texting, and communicating every way possible, even I was thinking we both had real feelings for each other.  I mustered up all my courage and expressed my feelings for her and she said she felt the same way.  I was relieved, ecstatic, and panicked all at the same time.  After getting over the initial shock and relief, I started thinking about how to proceed.  Eventually I convinced her to let me come see her in Sweden, where she was from.  She was amenable to the idea although never jubilant about it, which, in hindsight, I should have taken as a warning sign.  Instead, I plowed ahead, full speed, blinded by my feelings and excitement.  To make a long story short, she was supposed to meet me at the airport.  But she wasn't there.

{"text":"We have been dating for over 5years and the talk was marriage wasn't something that we were allowed to discuss in any of our homes. We tried to make our parents understand our point of view but you know how South Asian families are when it comes to caste and religion. Only thing Oshan and I knew that very day back in April was that we were going to get married that month and we were going to go ahead with our plans no matter what obstacles we would have to face. See, Asian families have this idea of who a perfect partner for your child is. The thing they don't understand is that they want their child to marry a stranger just because they like that person, not even considering the opinion or the choice of their own child. Our case was similar. He was tall and I was short, I was a bit on the chubby side and I wore glasses. The only issue his family had with me was that I was fat, ugly and a christian. Too bad they didn't realize that I was a warrior. There was this one time when his father actually told my father that I was fat, and my father responded saying, \"I feed my children well and unlike your kids mine aren't malnourished.\"! My parents were supportive of our marriage and relationship unlike his parents. Getting back to April, we decided we would get married after witnessing our families fight with each other regarding our relationship for nearly 2 years.

The skies were a bit dark and all of us were worried that it might rain in the evening, and it sure did! He came over with his friends in the pouring rain and was wearing a light grey suit. I was in an emerald green dress with a bouquet of flowers made with yellow, white and green. It was beautiful. Everything went according to plan. The only people missing were his family.

We quickly got ourselves ready at home and hurriedly packed ourselves into our small commuter sedan to start our day. On the way to the mall I asked my daughter, \"what is it like being 7? I'm sure it beats being 6 still!\". Blushing, she responded,\" I'm one step closer to being as old as you mommy! I wanna be just like you one day\". Her response melted my heart, I knew she always looked up to me for guidance and strength during times she wasn't feeling strong spirited, but it was even more meaningful to actually hear her say it out loud. As a single mother of 5 years, I always wanted to be strong for my little girl, and after her dad walked out on us, I knew she needed a strong role model in her life. Therefore, I made it my life's goal to do just that. Once we stopped at the mall in the next town over I started feeling this chest pain again that I experienced for the past two days. It wasn't something I was overly concerned about at the time, but it certainly did cause me enough pain to end the conversation I was having with my daughter. I didn't want to show her that I was in pain because mom's aren't supposed to get sick. Continuing to ignore the pain, we entered the mall ready to have a great day together when all of a sudden, the intensity of the pain grew even more. The pain was so bad that i dropped to my knees to the floor and yelled for someone to call an ambulance. it felt like my ribcage was about to cave in on itself. In a daze, I woke up in the ER in what seemed to be in a split second of travel.

There is enough medicine now to keep people out of pain. If someone is in that much pain that they want to die, they can just be medicated so they don't feel anything. Even if they hang on for years and years, that is better than killing them. If we allow people to kill themselves just because they are terminally ill, maybe sick people in the future will all be killed.","label":0}

The look on his face was precious. His main drive was to get away for his birthday so we couldn't think of a better place. He has a lot of the home movies of disney all memorized. He loves dumbo and bambi the most. He has only seen pictures of was disney world was all about. So seeing it for the first time was quite the experience for him. He has a very good time. All the main disney characters were met and hugged too. The rides were a new experience for him.","label":0}

{"text":"The funny thing is my husband always told me that when he first met me he wanted me to be the mother of his child, even though he already had Tim from his previous marriage.  It makes me laugh now when I think about it because with Laila and Marcus from my previous marriage, I always said to him those two were the best behaved children ever, and I didn't want to jinx my luck by having any more.  I couldn't believe how insistent he was that we just had to have another baby to unite our kids and complete our little blended family.  Sure enough though after months of trying to convince me that this would be good for us, I finally gave in to the idea.  But, then I thought about it again, diary:  Did I really want to have to worry about Pediatricians again?  Daycare costs again?  Especially after I'd gotten comfortable with having older kids that I practically grew up with!  I was in such a good place.  The weird thing about it all is that I remember he and I were together and I just knew what he was trying to do.  At first, I was skeptical, but then I began getting excited about the possibility of having his baby.  After all we didn't have one together, and our blended family was working so well that we both knew it was right. I just couldn't believe how upset I was when I took the first of a few tests and it came out negative.  Eventually, I began to accept the fact that at 35 years old, I didn't NEED to have another baby at all, and this was life's way of saying that I wasn't suppose to have another baby.  I was OKAY with that Diary!!!  We enjoyed our life and family time. It's just funny how Dana's baby shower changed it all for us for some reason.  When I came home that night from Norfolk, and I began telling him about the shower and how excited Sasha and her husband were and how cute the gifts were, I could see just feel the idea of having another baby getting him worked up and excited.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that that was the night our little man was conceived!  After 2 eventful years, it took me going to a baby shower for a friend for our son to decide that he wanted to come into the world too!  Life is so crazy, but I wouldn't have it any other way.","label":0}
{"text":"Five months ago I had my child. I was honored and blessed to give birth to a beautiful, healthy baby and couldn't wait to share my journey with my child.  Labor were relatively easy and seeing my daughter after anticipating her arrival brought me so much joy. However I began to feel a bit different from usual. Sure, we all have bad days and no one is 100 percent happy all the time but my level of happiness started to decrease. The beautiful baby I had became a afterthought as I only wanted to curl up in bed and just sleep my life away. I had little to no energy , my emotions started to significantly go down and I just did not care anymore. Not only about my child but myself and others around me. Thanks to my husband who helped me tremendously during the days I want to give up, including giving up my own child! It was a very emotional time and I finally worked up the courage to see the doctor about what I were feeling. He told me I was suffering post partum depression. Beforehand I looked up the signs and most of symptoms ticked off the checkbox. He began medication for me and offered therapy if I choose to go that route. I accepted it because I refused to live my life feeling numb constantly. I wanted to be here for my daughter, loved ones, and took active steps to make it sure I am able to provide emotional care. To me it was long journey to break out of that dark place and people were amazed that I \"snapped\" out it so quickly but they did not realize how hard I fought to be where I am today.","label":0}

I have to admit, I always pictured myself getting this far in life, but I didn't think it'd be so soon. I was always driven and wanted to succeed no matter where I was at. This job, though, was something that I had no confidence in at first. I was a nervous wreck when I started. Now, everything seems to come naturally. I grew as a person from this job. I am finally getting a taste of that sweet life. I grew up fairly poor so this is something that I was hoping for. I don't want to have to worry about bills anymore, and if I play my cards right, I won't have to. When I look at my paycheck every other week, it gives me a warm feeling inside.

{"text":"My journey started in the early hours of Friday, as I took off to deliver some product from my firm to one of my distributor in another state close to the Northwest region of the Country. I went alongside \"Mascot\" my Dog, a German Shepard, Mascot was more than just my pet, he understands me perfectly well, and I always love having him around. From swiftly drawing my attention to what happening around as I drove by different cities. Little did I wonder how boring the journey would have been without \"Mascot\", during my voyage I stopped by in a town to get something for myself and Mascot, and as I walked into a mini mart, all attention was just on Mascot. Virtually everyone around appreciated his beauty, from his gallantry stand to his face structure and hairy skin. As I continued my journey I and Mascot were kind of having some conversations, as he had quickly finished what I got for him, he still wanted mine, I couldn't resist seeing him with the look on his face whenever he wants something from me. I didn't know how far I and Mascot had traveled until I got to a place to pee. Then I overheard some guys speaking an Hausa language, then I knew I was already close to the region of my destination. I got inside my truck to continue my journey and as I continued Mascot wouldn't even sleep for a moment. He didn't like the fact that I had to confined him to a sit belt. He wanted his usually freedom as he always have back at home. After moving for some hours more, I finally arrived at compound where I came to distribute product. I sighed hmm!! and rub Mascot on the head and said he made my journey worth it. I met the person in charge at the place. We discuss what I actually came to do.","label":0}
{"text":"Today my son left West Virginia and went back to Florida with his father. He is 23 years old and had a wonderful job offer he had decided to take. I don't care how old he is, he is my youngest, my baby, and it hurts that he left. I am scared and nervous that he will need me but I will not be there to help him and guide him on the right decisions in his life. I am going to miss him so much. We would talk about everything and I feel like this separation will pull us apart. I know in my head that he is a grown man and has to make decisions that are right for him but my heart wants to hold him close. I tried to be happy for him and to put on a strong face. When he left he cried, hugged me close and said he would miss me. That broke my heart. I cried so hard I felt like I was dying inside. Of course his father told me I was being ridiculous, I don't care what he says, I feel like a part of me is gone. My older son Tim, he is staying here and I have to hold on to that. I love him just as much as Kenny but we were never as close. He does not confide in me and ask me for guidance. I don't feel like he needs me as much anymore. I hated living in Florida. It was always hot and the people there are selfish and mean. West Virginia feels like home. I love it here. But to be here means losing out on being with my son. I feel so torn but I have to do what is right for me. He has to grow and become a man on his own. I understand but I don't want to let go. I hope I can stay strong for them both.","label":1}

{"text":"I am just finishing up my summer vacation - 3 weeks in Vermont visiting friends and family.  I come visit once a year, but I don't usually get to spend this much time here, which was great!  I grew up here in a semi rural community, but my parents got a great job offer in NY so we moved to Albany.  We still have a cabin up here out in the woods not too far from where I grew up so that's where I stay when I (or we!) come visit.  I spent the first few days of the trip just getting settled in with my dog Sasha, and we did a lot of hiking around.   I love nature and even seeing the same places when I come, they are always still just as beautiful. I had been going through a bit of a rough patch since I broke up with my gf of 3 years and this was exactly what I needed. Speaking of, the festival itself was fantastic.  I hooked up with a few people still left in town from HS that I grew up with and the first day we pregamed pretty good before we went.  They had plenty of live music and people from all over the state came with almost anything you could want.  My favorite parts were the garlic and cheese sections, the garlic people were set up in front on days 1 and 2 while the cheese folks were in the spotlight on days 4 and 5.  One of my friends actually got me to be on the panel for judging dishes there as well, which I couldn't thank them for enough.  It was so much fun and I got to get a bunch of recipes to bring back home with me!  Plus, I got to meet a chef from a few towns over who has their own show on the Food Network.  For someone who loves cooking as much as me, I felt like I was meeting an idol almost! Other than that, we spent a lot of time out in nature, bringing Sasha with us to our favorite lake to swim in from when we were kids.  My friends and I even spent a few days hiking even deeper into nature and pitching tents for a mini camping trip.  It was definitely one of my favorite visits out here!  I was able to completely get back in tune with myself and let nature and people boost me back up when I was down.","label":0}

{"text":"About four months ago, I took my son to his first swimming lesson. My son was about six months old at the time, so this was really his first introduction to pools or any sort of water outside of the bath. He was very receptive to the whole experience. He didn't cry, and was more interested in observing the other kids in the pool. I was surprised at how observant he was. The fact that he was simply taking in the whole experience was wonderful. It was suggested that I briefly put his face in the water, and to my surprise, he seemed to enjoy it! This was a very special experience for me because I remember going to pools and swimming in creeks and lakes when I was a kid. I'm glad that he was okay being almost entirely submerged in the water. This was one event that I was really looking forward to before he was born. Since he was born in December, I was worried that he might not be old enough to do swim lessons this past summer. But I'm very glad that we didn't have to wait until next year. I felt like he really relied on me in that pool. Up until that time, my wife was always there to help me with parenting if I run into trouble. This was my first real time being the primary parent. All in all, it was a very positive experience and I'm glad I got to be the one to introduce him to the swimming pool.","label":1}
{"text":"The biggest thing to happen to me is finding out I am going to be a father. My wife and I had been trying to conceive a child for sometime now.  But we hadn't had much success.  However, we found out in march that we were pregnant!  I can't begin to describe the excitement that I felt when I found out we were having a baby.  I was so happy to find this news out as was my family!  Then a couple months later we found out we were having a girl!!  At first I was scared because being a guy I knew I didn't know all the ins and outs of what a girl goes through.  The one thing I knew for sure was that there was nobody that would love this girl more than I do!  I can't wait for her to get here.  My wife and I decided on a name right away.  We came to the decision rather easily without much fuss.  It's a name that we have liked for some time now.  My mom is also very excited about it, because my nieces from my sister are getting older now.  So it'll be nice for her to have a baby to care for.  Again this is probably the biggest moment of my life let alone the last 6 months.","label":1}
{"text":"It has been a few weeks since I started trying to help out more around the house and everything. My wife had a serious talk with me and I guess I didn't realize how obnoxious I had been. Ever since the baby was born I haven't really been pulling my weight around the house. I was coming home from work everyday and playing video games and staring at my cell phone. I didn't mean to be unhelpful, I just got caught up in feeling overwhelmed I guess. And my wife never asks for help, so I just thought she had it all under control. After she talked to me I realized I was very wrong. She was about to lose her mind and I am glad she spoke up. I felt terrible, I never meant to add extra stress to her day. After that conversation I have been trying to be helpful and present at all times.  I know I still probably have a long way to go but I am really trying. I asked my wife today how she was feeling about the situation and she seemed a little bit less angry. I also don't want her to think I am just helping out because she wants me to. It is a difficult situation to fix. But it is my fault that the situation exists so I am going to keep trying. I think I am on the right track. I hope anyway.","label":0}

{"text":"I was born in a small city in San Jose, where I lived in a rich neighborhood surrounded by multi-storey buildings. My mother and father parted ways when I was just 4 years old, and I lived with my mom and two older brothers. I rarely saw my father, although he was still a part of my life and made me try different sports or went bicycling with me. I rarely dwell in the past and sometimes my distant memories even seem to be from another person\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s life. I have changed so much over the years that I often wonder what kind of magic lead me to this current place. I am so used to my new self that sometimes I can\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t even explain my transformation. Everything has become so natural that if someone asked me how can I be so happy or peaceful, then it\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s possible that I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t know the answer. Happiness just seems to be the natural state for humans. Why should I be miserable? However, that kind of attitude would\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4ve been a complete utopia many years back, because I felt like the most unfortunate person alive.

I was also invited to my grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s birthday by my family, but I chose to stay home and go to my friend\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s place instead. But before that I went to a nearby shop to buy some snacks. There I met a few friends, who wished for some excitement. I still had about 2 hours until the birthday party so I decided to join them. There was an abandoned and fenceless construction site near my home, which was our typical playground. We had gone there dozens of times before to play games or have a picnic. On that day the four of us decided to play hide and seek, so we split into two teams. We crawled through the hollow spaces of long blocks of concrete, made silent movements and scouted around the place, sometimes lifting our heads up to see where the other boys were located. I felt very excited like normally. Nothing seemed to be different. But suddenly\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c2\u00b6 after my teammate had finished scouting, he jumped off a concrete block which was insecurely supported by another. The jump caused the block to lose its balance while I was directly in front of it. As soon as I realized that, I was already on the ground face down, noticing only some dust flying around.","label":1}

I got help from a friend and he suggested that I really need to just watch what I eat and try to get on a set sleep schedule. I knew that those were some of my problems, and I wanted to fix them all, so if that was the start then I'd try. It went well and I could tell that sleeping better and more regularly was a big help. I started to feel healthier and things became less of a struggle. I started being motivated to live and wake up. I wanted to keep improving. I was trying so hard now because I could see improvements.

Everyone who came to celebrate with me brought a dish to pass. We had quite the feast going! There was lasagna, salad, cookies, cake, pie of all kinds, tacos, pizza, juice, soda and so much more. I ate more than I should have but it was totally worth it. Before the party was over we decided to draft our fantasy football players. Most of us were in a league together.

They didn't inform their employees, but each of us were let go for not complying with the changes. Yes, it really doesn't make it any better. I live in a rural area. Jobs don't exist that I qualify for. I was walking blindly after the layoff, desperately trying to figure out how I could possibly live on my savings, which is supposed to be for a car since I had to trade mine for housing. It was a struggle to get out of bed, and self-care was at zero. I would fill out applications like a zombie, knowing it would be near impossible to make an interview with my car situation. The closest town is 20 miles away. I looked into online jobs, but most required something upfront or they were scams. I went back to freelance writing and editing. However, I'm not great with marketing or self-promotion, so it left me with content mills. If you don't know, they're like the penny\/underpaid hits asking you to write with an enormous chance of it being rejected because the \"client\" is picky or was unclear. I just couldn't do that and raise my family without feeling like I was treading water. Then I stumbled across a Reddit called Beer Money. I started reading posts from people who were making more than I was for far less work on a very specific site. This is how I discovered, essentially, my savior. Mturk approved me on the spot. It was a trusted platform, and while I won't ever become rich from the work, I'm left with satisfaction from doing surveys, little tasks, and even this one.

Later on that night my girlfriend unexpectedly slapped me across the face and told me it was because of my behavior earlier. I was very shocked because this had never happened before. I did not react much because I was so taken off guard. She did not react much either. She just simply told me to continue watching TV and acted like it never happened.

{"text":"Dear Diary, On my birthday this year I turned 54 years old and reached the nine year anniversary of a dreadful time that forever changed my life. To celebrate and mark the occasion my grown son took me to Walt Disney World for a week long vacation. I had never been to Disney World and, being a lifetime fan of Disneyland, having the chance to experience this park with my son was a dream come true. I had become very ill nine years ago and nearly lost my life to liver and heart failure. The illness came out of the blue and remains an unknown etiology as far as my physician is concerned. My recovery and transformation has been time consuming and come with many changes to my life, abilities, and career. My son walked along my side during my illness and knew that reaching a point where I could travel with him would be the best reward I could hope for. Our vacation was amazing from the moment we reached Florida and boarded the Disney bus. Our resort hotel was absolutely beautiful and the parks were amazing. Animal Kingdom was by far our favorite resort with Epcot a close second. My son had been very careful to book all of our dining reservations with my needs in mind. A chef came to our table to ask me about my dietary restrictions and made beautiful meals for me. We even had a refrigerator and microwave in our room so I could prepare my own breakfast each day. We both agreed that Disneyland still outshines any theme park and will be our family favorite. I rarely spend long periods of time with my son since he is 32, very busy in his career, and travels the world for business. Having this week with him, building memories, and sharing new experiences is a time I will always treasure.","label":1}

I got an after school job and my mom took a temp job at the bank.  I liked out new town and home but worried we wouldn't be able to afford to stay. Then, a miracle happened!  My mom was talking to a bank customer about how we came to town and she was offered a new job.  It paid better and let her  get back into her chosen field.  So now we can stay in town permanently.  I am so happy things worked out this time but i hope my mom has a better radar for idiot boyfriends in the future.  I hate knowing my life can be upended so easily.","label":0}

{"text":"I can't stop thinking about that wonderful trip two months ago. We stayed at a bed and breakfast in South Carolina for about 3 days then went to visit cousin Merl in Georgia for a few days. The bed and breakfast was beautiful and they were very hospitable. It was right on the beach. Living in California for all my life, I've never seen the sunrise over the ocean. The Atlantic was just beautiful. The innkeepers made mom a special birthday cake and dinner which was so lovely. They really showed us some great hospitality. Cousin Merl's was so much fun too. We got to catch up and see all of our southern brethren. Cousin Merl has a zipline in his back yard. It is awesome! Cousin Merl's place is so gorgeious nestled up in the hills. It was so green and peaceful. You don't hear any cars going or airplanes. Until he starts up his dune buggy of course! That was fun too. I can't wait to go back.","label":0}
{"text":"I believe that Gay Marriage should be legal everywhere. The bonds between two consenting adults should not be judged based on religion, especially in a nation where people can be free from religion. Love between two gay people is just a valid as love between straight people. The traditional purpose of marriage is outdated and has no place in the making of policy. Plenty of people get married and do not have children, do not consolidate property, and the wife is certainly not \"owned\" by the husband.","label":1}
{"text":"The one thing that I remember and can think about better than any in my entire life is the birth of my daughter. I have always wanted a daughter and never imagined that I would be having one. All of my family, including cousins, aunts, uncles, and anyone for the past 3 generations has had boys. There are no girls in our family over those 3 generations. The day that we had the revealing ultrasound was one of the happiest days of my life. The day she was born was the best and it was unimaginable how it would change my life. I am so thankful and grateful for having her. I couldn't imagine life being any other way. The amount of love that I never imagined having blew me away. When she was brought out, I remember the look she had. It was almost as if she was looking at me and could see every notion of my being. I know she couldn't see, but it sure felt like it. Her eyes were looking directly at me and she didn't whimper one bit. That day is a day I could never forget. It was the most beautiful and captivating face I have ever seen. My daughter who looked exactly like me. It's crazy to think about it, but she sis a spitting image of myself.","label":1}
{"text":"I woke up early, excited for the day.  I was going kayaking, with my brother and his girlfriend.  We ate breakfast then loaded up the truck with the kayaks and drove out to the dock.  After parking and getting set up we were ready to go out on the river.  We had coolers filled with drinks and sandwiches, fruit and snacks. My brother's girlfriend started drinking as soon as she woke up, and didn't eat breakfast so the drinks started hitting her hard before we were even out on the water.  As we started kayaking I was having fun, but it was apparent that my brother's girlfriend was drinking too much and was going to have some issues.   She immediately lost her paddle and we had to hurry to grab it for her. She thought it was funny, well she thought everything was funny thanks to the influence of alcohol, and while she started laughing and having fun, my brother and I were in damage control mode, having to watch her and make sure that she was ok. I wasn't able to have a good time because everytime we got into a rhythm on the water, she would flip her kayak and we'd have to stop and fix everything again.  I was getting really frustrated, if she hadn't drank so much then we could be having an enjoyable time. I think next time my brother asks me to go kayaking with him I'm going to specify that it should only be me and him, that way I can have fun without worrying about another person.  I really wanted to have a good time today, I'm miffed that I wasn't able to because of one person.  Maybe if she would've ate breakfast it wouldn't have been so bad. I'm going to have a talk with my brother about this, maybe he can tell her how uncool her actions were.  I enjoy drinking and having a good time too, but not when we're doing something in water, that can be dangerous.","label":0}
{"text":"I recently went to my best friend's wedding in Spain. This was about 4 months ago, and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people. Since I have been back, I have already begun planning my trip back, as well as learning Spanish, and this trip had a strong unexpected impact on my life.","label":1}
{"text":"My dad was a great man. He started off from a backround of poverty and had to fight for everything he earned. He worked odd jobs, at all hours of the day in order to build himself and his family a better life. This is that story. He became a construction worker to pay for school. He liked working with his hands, but he knew that it would not be sustainable in the long run for his body and for his health. He still liked the possibilities of design and construction so he became an architecht. His ultimate dream was to build a house for us that he could be proud of. He worked all day and studied all night. He worked on some incredble projects as the city we grew up in experienced an economic boom. He helped build tall skyscrapers and schools and other buildings. But he never lost sight of his dream. Finally, he was able to save enough money to try his hand at his dream. He was able to build a grand house that he could safely keep his family in after so many years. I remember hearing this story and being in awe of the effort and dedication my father had towards providing us a good home. I'll never forget his sacrifices and his hard work and hope that I can do the same. It really was a true inspiration.","label":0}
{"text":"I had really been struggling with my faith lately. It just felt like I was going through the motions. Finding the motivation to go to church was a real struggle. In fact, I had missed church multiple times over the summer. But, a couple of weeks ago, I decided it was time to snap out of it. I set my alarm extra early. I prayed that I would feel refreshed. I also prayed that I would stay awake and really absorb the message. And I am glad that I did. It ended up being a very powerful service. The message was all about finding our calling. And they had a volunteer fair after the service. I felt like God was really talking to me. I decided to volunteer to work with one of the youth programs. I started it last week, and am already in love with it. The kids are great and I feel like I am making a difference. I feel like my prayers were really answered.","label":0}
{"text":"This is the intro to my story. It's a base understanding about the benefits of life and me being grateful for them. Also giving praises to The Most High (TMH) for allowing me to do so. Every God allows me to awake is another day to serve him. My days usually go by simple enough: wake eating\/or drink sometimes both if money available or the want or need to is here. Studying the Bible and people, animals and the world around me is fascinating in itself. I study and apply God's laws through the faith of Jesus Christ: by overcoming my trials and tribulations, giving charity whether it be in the form of wisdom or materials, and working with others in various communities throughout the united states so far. Ok so waking up the first thing I do is show thanks to God. Next is some scripture reading, videos, or music. Next up is food. I've taken a so called \"vegan\" route recently so I focus on fruits vegetables, grains and foods from trees. Among drinks I have water (various types) along with fruit juices(natural are preferred). When it comes to milk I use almond, rice, oat, etc. Then finding some form of work. I am growing to understand that tradition work in most people minds that I've grown up with (9-5) is not the best form. So I am constantly looking \"work\" or the lifestyle where I get paid to do what I love. Most of it is teaching even if its online or not. It's always in the spectrum of making life more honorable even in the lowest situations or at least that's where I'm beginning at even though our history doesn't start from those \"cloths\" This journey is forever so growth is always expected even in the smallest area such as appearance changes, updating tech, and understanding people situations to guide them to overcome SIN and parts of their lives they don't like. Just those few actions are almost always a full day.","label":1}
{"text":"Recently, about a month ago, I went to a comic convention with various members of my family. I had been reading comics since I was a little girl, with my passion being promoted y my family. I had built an impressive collection of comic books, and I loved the environment. I just felt that I belonged, you know? These are my people! I wont ever forget that day, I was excellent. I went to many booths and talked to many creators. I got merchandise signed, I went down artist's alley. I remember just talking to a bunch of different artists about their favorite fandoms. I even got to talk to a few professional comic artists! We didn't go to a particularly large convention, we went a regional one that was more local. However, I felt this increased the closeness of everyone there, and I was happy to see that well known creators came despite it. I enjoyed that day, and I hope to be able to do it again some day! I want to be able to bring my family there again. Anyway, it was very, very, very, very fun!","label":0}
{"text":"This last summer on a beautiful day our family went kayaking in Indianapolis on the White river. We have been kayaking and canoeing before. But this is the first time we have been on this particular river and we were excited. It was especially exciting because my oldest son was bringing his significant other along as his fiance. He had asked her just the week before. So myself and my husband got a double kayak, my son and his fiance got a double kayak and my youngest son got a single kayak. It was a 4 hour trip which we did in about 3 because the youngsters didn't let the old folks slack. My husband did not know how to steer the dang kayak so there was some yelling until we kind of got the gist of it. He is lucky he didn't get a oar up side of his head! Next time I am going to get a single kayak! We all got to talk and laugh with each other while we paddled down the river. The best thing is that they really couldn't get away from us so they had to spend time with old ma and pa. Not that they didn't want to anyway. They even got to see me fall in the river as clumsy me tried to climb back into the kayak. This was after I pulled the kayak through a shallow part with my husband in it! We got sunburned, we were tired and I ached from physical exercise. Basically, it was a great day spent as a family that we don't get enough anymore.","label":1}

The weather condition was also great. I made new friends who were ready to learn and explore. The locals took me on various tours. They have good game reserve. I really enjoyed my entire time there.

{"text":"This past winter I was invited to photograph my good friends Alex and Megan getting married. This was my first wedding I've done solo and was pretty nerve wracking to remember everything I had to do. On top of everything they wanted to do it outdoors which is fine usually but with where we live and what time of year it was which was March proved to be a little challenging. But it was a task I was up for doing for a couple of friends. The day started out with to be one of the coldest of the year at a brisk 10 degrees Fahrenheit out highs of about 15 that day would prove to be great weather under shaded trees behind their grandparents house. The first thing was photographing the bride which was great and inside where it was nice and warm. The groom I had to photography outside first while he kept his hands warm to take pictures without his gloves on as that would look silly. The wedding short while and the bride walked down through a candle lined path in the woods to finally get married after 10 years at a surprise wedding none of our friends knew about just their family. It was a great ceremony quick because of the cold followed by quick photos outside where they got married. We finished the day having the reception at a popular resort drinking the night away. The dinner was Filet minion and salmon with wonderful vegetables that were out of this world great. The cake that night was amazing too and surprisingly they did not smash it into each others faces. We spent 5 hours talking that night and drinking by the fire there until the venue told us we had to move on for the night. It was amazing to photography their special day and be invited to do it as one of the only friends to know they were getting married. It meant a lot that they would not only choose me to do it but also that they would let me know about the surprise wedding and partake in the day.","label":1}
{"text":"My family and I went on a trip to southern Utah to check out the rock formations and the unique environment. We brought our trailer house and we had plans to get to the campground in Duck Creek Village around 3 PM on the day of arrival. On our trip down, about 2 hours into the drive, we were in the middle of nowhere when the truck lost power and started making a horrible whining sound. We were on the interstate and had a max speed of 30 miles an hour. We were also in a one lane construction zone with no shoulder to pull off on to, so we were stuck on the freeway, 1 lane, cars piling up behind us, going 30 miles an hour. We reached the next exit nearly 45 minutes later. I had a couple tools in the trailer and opened up the hood to see if a spark plug cable or something had an issue. I couldn't find any obvious problems. I was completely perplexed. I then called the insurance company for a tow truck, but since we were so far from every city, it took 2 hours for a truck to come. We eventually had a tow truck reach us and towed the truck back the direction we came to the nearest dealership. It has been 72 days and the truck still is in the repair shop without any knowledge of what happened to it. We were able to borrow a truck from a relative that lived close by and got to the campground just after midnight that night. The trip went off without a hitch afterwards","label":1}
{"text":"I sent my kids to go stay with their Uncle, Aunt and Cousins this summer thinking it would be a good way for them to be a part of their dad's family, especially since they haven't seen their dad in years.  Everyone was very excited to spend time together, get to play together and become a family in spite of their dad.  The boys got along with the Uncle and the cousins, who are all girls, got along with my daughter.  The only one no one could stand was the aunt (newly married). The visit took a bad turn when the Aunt started treating my daughter more like an 'evil step daughter' than one of her family.  If my daughter left out clothes or food she would call her many ugly names and send her away to her room alone.  It made a weird rift between my daughter and her cousins, Uncle and brother.  No one felt comfortable and my daughter called every day for me to allow her to fly home.  I don't quite understand anything that happened because their last visit last summer was amazing and my daughter didn't even want to come home.  My daughter felt picked on and her brothers didn't do anything to aleviate the situation.  Her biological uncle made things worse by feeding the fuel and going back to his wife saying nasty things about my daughter.  It was just an ugly situation and I was glad when she got home.  My relationship was never great with them but now it's non-existent.  I'm happy that the boys maintained a good relationship with their uncle and cousins but the lashing out from their Aunt to their sister has scared their relationship forever and has put the boys in an awkward situations.  At least the Uncle has been calling the boys every week to check in.

{"text":"About 3 months ago, I sneaked out of the house after dinner for a lonely cigarette. I was in my pajamas and house slipper. I finished my smoke, grounded the bud and was about to go into house. when i slipped on something and hit the nearby lamp and landed hard on the pavement. It was a cold night and there was not anyone around. My best chances of surviving were to reach my home. I was down on the pavement and hidden from view by a car. I was not able to get up. I could not move or make any noise. I felt blood oozing from the back of my head, where it hit the paver block. i felt blood on both sides, presumable from when I had hit myself twice during my fall. With every passing minute, my survival was becoming questionable. I was worried that I will pass out and bleed to death.  I was thinking who will be coming around the street, at this hour? There was another thought in my mind, if anyone in my family would miss me at home? Will someone from my family will come looking for me? My kids will be be hooked on to the wifi and glued to their smart screens, ipad or laptop or mobiles. My wife will be busy doing the dishes and getting things ready for a swift morning departure to school and office. She may realize I was missing after another 60 or 90 or minutes. This made me to wonder, will I be around after 60 or 90 minutes? I couldn't remember anything after this. I was after a long time when I felt a tug and someone was lifting me up. some sort of bandage was on my neck, it was causing pain and restricting my head movements.","label":0}

About 5 or 6 months ago now, I went to work like any other day. Got to my cubicle, started up my computer and started designing the catalog spreads. Everything was going just fine. That's when my mom called. Dad was in a car accident. He was being life-flighted to the hospital in critical condition and I needed to get to Maine ASAP. I don't remember if I even told my boss I was leaving, I just got up and ran out. I may not have even punched out. Traffic, of course, was terrible as it was a holiday weekend. It took me an hour to even get out of town, when normally it takes 20 minutes. The whole time, I was panicked. I tried to keep my cool because, no sense in getting into an accident myself. That's when I got another call. It was my mom again, she was in tears. She wanted to tell me, so I didn't fly there as fast as she knew I was, that he passed away on arrival to the hospital. His injuries were just too severe. I pulled over, and broke down. I have lived in New Hampshire for a couple years now, but have always wanted to move back to Maine where I am from. I can't believe I didn't move back in time. This truly has been the worst year of my life.","label":0}

My dad and my brother were taking about people of different races and kept laughing about how they weren't racist and how they thought that other races complained too much about their issues. My dad said \"I even hire them!\" in reference to black people. But when he criticized black hairstyles, I questioned him. I asked him if he knew why black people even wore some of those hairstyles, (they're protective hairstyles). My dad said something that disgusted me to my core. He said, \"To keep the bugs out?\" The level of ignorance that my dad exhibits is so upsetting to me, even now. I try to make peace with the fact that he is who he is but it's really difficult to. I feel depressed, I feel anxious, and I hate that I can still hear them laughing. I'm half puerto rican.  My brother is too. My dad is Italian.

In the months prior to Kisses' passing I noticed she had become lethargic and wasn't her usual spunky self. She'd lost interest in playing. She stopped hanging out on her usual perches. Eventually stopped jumping on to the couch and even on to my bed. I was worried. Then, I began to notice her breathing become labored and wheezy. I made an appointment to have her checked out by her long time veterinarian and expected that he would give Kisses some antibiotics and tell me she'd be fine in no time. But, that's not what happened and I had my heartbroken to learn Kisses had lung cancer. The treatment she would have needed to survive was more than I could afford and I felt like I had failed her. I couldn't let her suffer. Watching Kisses struggle and not enjoy the things she used to was crushing and I knew it was because I couldn't afford to help her.

{"text":"On August 5, 2019, the one thing that worries me each day, has finally happened. I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention. This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come.      The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry, and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low. The funds, I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation.     Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place.     I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot money for many years. The confidence I had in my driving has still not come back, and this makes me feel like I lack ability and weak-minded. I hope this passes, because I do not like feeling worse about my life. I will have to work on getting my confidence back, and reducing the amount of daily worry I have. This was not a great day or experience, and has definitely impacted my life each day since August 5th, but I think it will pass soon and I can have finally my mind and confidence back.","label":1}

{"text":"Let me tell you about the first time I used a chainsaw. It happened at the end of May this year. My mother got a letter from the city about some land that she didn't know she owned, and how the overgrown state of it was making the neighbors upset. They gave us a month to clear the land or they'd do it for us and put a lien on the property for the amount it took to do so It's in a residential neighborhood and apparently health and safety is important. She doesn't have the kind of money necessary to pay someone to do it, so my mother decided that I would do it for her. Mom went down to ABC Rental, and rented a chainsaw, lawnmower, and what I can only describe as a chainsaw on a stick (which I was too scared to use). There were only 8 dead trees on the property, and my sanity does appreciate that, but I had to cut down each one by myself as my mother chain-smoked in her car. Well, she was there on the first day, I had to come back several times by myself. Did you know that equipment like chainsaws don't take straight gasoline to power? I didn't, and I was really surprised to find out I needed an oil mixture to make it all run. And, though the guys at ABC Rental told her this, my mother didn't see fit to tell me about it at all. So, after some severe googling, I finally got the thing running. I had to look up videos of tree cutting on YouTube in order to see what I was supposed to be doing. Cut out a triangle in the direction you want to tree to land, and go for it. I went for it. It didn't really work. Or, I didn't really work. Using a chainsaw requires an upper body strength that I don't have. The trees fell in the general direction that I wanted them to, but I had to be really careful about where I was and what I was doing. Which is natural, I guess. It was so much work. I, as a 32 year old woman completely unequipped for this type of task, did my best. I could only do one tree per day because I tired out so easily. I will never do this type of work again. I only slightly resent my mother for it, too.","label":1}

Well now my kids are grown and I have the chance to better myself.  Today is my first day of Biology 101 and I am going to rock it.  Everybody tells me it's too late, and I know it will be a lot of work, but I've balanced more before.  I've raised two kids while working full time without any support from a man. I've taken all the prereqs at the community college to get ready and it has been work but I know I can do it.  I will be so glad to walk across the stage and get my diploma and even more to see the words \"Medical Doctor\" next to my name.  I am not turning back till I achieve my goal.  I can do this.  My kids will be so proud. I want to show them what can be done if you just put your mind to it.  Day 1 starts now.  Let's begin.","label":0}
{"text":"Abortion should be legalized everywhere, in every situation, and here is why. Women need to have the freedom that they deserve and not be tied down to unwanted and unloved children. Allowing women to get abortions is a case of women's rights. Men get to go around an do whatever they want, to whoever they want, and they don't have to pay the consequences for any of it. Why should it be fair that men can do this while women who practice the same things and have the same ideas can be punished with an unwanted pregnancy. It isn't right! Women should be able to choose.","label":0}

The bus ride there always takes about 45 min, Today there was a lady riding the whole way there with me. I wonder who she was going to see. The weather today was a bit cold and clammy and I should have worn my boots over shoes. I got there around 10am, which is right after breakfast which is always a good time to go a visit as everyone is wide awake. The most interesting woman was sitting and talking to my grandmother when I arrived. My grandmother introduce her as Edith and she moved here from Estonia shortly after the war.  She told me about how she been in some of the pride rallies back then. That she had seen Hitler speak before he came to power and liked him. It was interesting to listen to someone who was welcoming of the Nazi party when they invaded her country. But after learning of the crimes the Nazi's did feels sad about ever liking Hitler. We spoke for about an hour and she told me all about her family life during the war. I stayed until after lunch and took the same bus home. The lady from earlier wasn't on the bus again, I wonder if she left already? Got home and made dinner for myself. I'm tired today and plan to get to sleep early.","label":0}

{"text":"I know being an adult escort is legally prostitution. I was arrested for it last year however got away with a slap on the wrist and a small fine. Sense I make such good money at it, it's usually well worth the risks. Well, after last night I'm reconsidering this profession. I got a referral from one of my regulars. Referrals go pretty well most of the time. I kind of know what to expect from the person who's referring them. When I arrive at the hotel room everything seemed normal so we immediately handled our financial business. He then went into bathroom and asked me to put on a blindfold. I was a little reluctant however, since it was a referral I did it anyway. Several minutes later he comes out of the bathroom takes me by the hand and opens the adjoining door to the room next door. He takes off my blindfold and I see that the entire room is filled with at least a thousand pieces of fresh fruit. I looked over at him, and to my utter shock, he's wearing nothing but an adult size baby diaper! Not to get into too much detail but he wanted me to do unspeakable things to him with the fruit. I had to think about it for a second but like I said, the money is good and besides no one was getting hurt. About 30 minutes go by then all of a sudden, there's was a very loud knocking at the door. Since he's in the diaper, I go to answer the door. To my surprise, it was the police saying that someone had called in a domestic disturbance happening in our room. Then without hesitation, my client blurts out \"She's a prostitute and she made me do it.\" So guess what? I get taken to jail and he's left to try and explain the \"situation\" to the police.","label":0}

It's been ages since I got along with someone so well, and everything we had in common made night one for the ages, plus there was a wedding happening! I can't believe Jake managed to get Vulfpeck to play his wedding. That's Jake's style though, all class, and an absolute jazz fanatic. I can't believe how much they must have paid for that shindig between the band, and that incredibe spread from Chez Gus. That guy is a big time chef, I didn't even think he did catering, but Jake can be a persuasive mofo. I guess the Franklins can be too haha. I honestly can't remember the last time I've had such a completely satisfying experience. That sounds underwhelming, but it cover all the bases and that's the best way to describe it. All 5 senses were satiated, the conversation was inteligent yet casual, and Julie sure made the overnight memorable. I think I will try and stay in touch with her, at the least. Who knows, maybe her and I can recreate that night someday, only swap ourselves in as the happy couple. Or maybe we can just hang and bang. Either way, it ought to be fun!","label":0}

We were classmates in college and our love story started from what other people may consider as the most boring way - through friendship. But if you were to ask me, it is not boring. It feels safe and secure since our relationship is founded on trust that we cultivated for a long time as friends. He actually did have a girlfriend before. They even have a kid - a kid who is very dear to my heart, Sam. Anyway, we were celebrating our third anniversary recently and we planned to do it in a park. We both wanted to have a picnic together with Sam. So that day, while we were setting up for the picnic, he suggested that we play a game. He said that while I was busy preparing, he hid something in grass nearby. He asked me and Sam to look for it and the first one to find it will have another scoop of ice cream. So, Sam and I did look for it and when I found it, I saw it has a note with Sam's drawing and the words: \"Will you be my Dad's wife?\". I was so shocked but what I didn't expect is when I turned around to face my boyfriend, he was already in his knees and our closest family and friends are standing a little further behind him with a banner saying: \"Will you marry me?\".","label":0}

They only realized this during the party, so they rushed out to buy a cake. When they finally had time to get to the bakery, they bought the first cake they could find without checking what kind it was. While they were gone, my nephew was opening his presents as fast as he could, because he was more interested in eating his cake than his actual presents. We watched as he opened many presents with new toys, without caring because he was so excited for his cake. When my aunt and uncle returned, he just about leapt out of his seat and ran to them. He couldn't wait to have a piece of his birthday cake. They sliced the cake with a knife, and gave him the first piece. When he tasted the cake, he immediately spat it out. It was carrot cake! He was so upset. He wasn't even interested in playing with his new toys because his birthday was ruined by the last-minute carrot cake his parents had bought. None of the adults thought the cake was terrible, we all enjoyed it. When we think back to my nephew's fifth birthday party, this is what we all remember and laugh about.","label":0}
{"text":"A person that I knew a long time ago passed away.  When I was a young child I lived with this person, so it was jarring to me.  There had been a lot of ups and downs over the years and I wasn't a part of this person's life anymore.  But hearing about their passing still made me feel a certain kind of way.  The reason that it affected me is that this person had played the role as parent in my life at one time.   The situation was not a good one, and their passing made me think about the life as it was at the time.  This person had lived a very long life, so I wasn't sad about that.  They were ninety-eight.  Their birthday would have been the 25th of this month and they would have turned ninety-nine.  Although I wasn't in direct contact with this person, I was hoping that they would reach one hundred.  Again, they lived a long time.  Of all the brothers and sisters that there were (I knew nine of them, there had been fourteen), there are, as far as I know, three of them left.

The last night we were in town we were looking for a place to eat. We were walking in down town Indianapolis and Mike suggested an area that had a \"Steak and Shake.\" We all gave him a hard time because we didn't want to go to a place we can eat at back home. We wanted something unique. We ended up getting an Uber back to our hotel and went to a local restaurant and bar. At the bar my brother in law Mike had a LOT to drink. He had 2 pitchers of bear and 2 shots. I have seen my brother in law drink, but never that much! He was gone! We went back to the hotel, but Mike couldn't walk. At the hotel he want to Matt, Todd and Garrets room and was keeping them awake. I was able to get Mike back to our room, and after laying down he said he had to go to the bathroom.

I was out on the porch talking to my husband on the phone, and my mom was holding my nephew and walking down the stairs, and he saw me and made her go get me so that I could put him down for a nap. This made me feel so happy because sometimes I worry that we don't have a super strong bond. My sister has a very strong bond with my daughter, and I want the same with her son. However, I worry about that not happening because they live in a different state now, so he doesn't get to spend a lot of time with me. It made me feel like we do have a really strong bond when he insisted on me doing his routine with him. I got to cuddle him while he drank some milk. Then, we went into his bedroom and read a couple of books. We cuddled some more while rocking in his rocking chair. Then, I laid him in his crib and he went right to sleep, just like he does for his mom. It made me feel like I was a regular part of his life. It meant a lot to me.","label":1}

What hospital are they taking him to?\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b9 Then the woman replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00baNo, he\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4s not going to the hospital.

I drove with little regard for speed limit or traffic lights right to the bank down the street where my husband was working at the time.  When I finally reached the bank I swung open the double glass doors as quickly as I could. I spotted my husband sitting quietly at his desk. There were some customers waiting in the lobby, but honestly I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t have cared less.

{"text":"My event of choice happened a few months ago.  My wife had been having back spasm issues from time to time.  We tried to get state medicaid to cover home care for the problem, but they required her to go to a doctor, which she was not able to do with her condition.  Finally, the problem got so severe that she had a major back spasm that would not relent.  As we had no car, I had to call 911 to get an ambulance to take her to the ER.  There, they verified it was a back spasm related to her herniated disc.  It was an emotionally difficult time for us all.  She was under great pain, so much that she could not speak.  I had to maintain my stress level, as I have high blood pressure, and call to get her treated.  Then, we were told that she would STILL have to go to her PCP to get treatment, but at least they gave her enough pain meds to get her there.  Over the weeks that would follow, there would be many, many consultation visits, scans, and lab works.  It was not easy, but they did finally get her on good meds, a back shot, and therapy...back at the ER that would not allowed to treat us at the start without all of this run around.  The event and following weeks put much financial and emotional strain on us.  It disrupted our ability to earn money, as we had increased bills.  However, it is good to know what the problem was.

{"text":"Hmm, this is not an easy topic to have a concrete opinion on. For instance, I believe in exercising free will - and if a human being chooses, at a mature point in life, that if they were to fall victim to a horrible accident or commendable old age, and they firmly wish to be euthanized then that is their right. It is the equivalent of \"pulling the plug\" on patients in irreversible comas and other vegetative states, and while that is deemed accaptable by society - why shouldn't a patient be able to express their desire to end things in a dignified way? There is a fine line between euthanasia and assisted suicide of course, but to be honest my views on the latter are quite similar. On the other hand, from the perspective of a relative or loved one of someone who chooses this way \"out\" - I cannot fathom what it would take for me to accept it. I am the type of person who will rip to shreds for the wellbeing of family and loved ones, and there is no way in hell that I would just give up on someone's life, even if it were akin to a vegetable. I would be fundamentally against such a decision, but I still think that it would be my duty to accept it out of respect for the wishes of those I love.","label":1}

I know she will always be there to support those around her with unconditional love. I have always been more of a cat person but admittedly have never had a dog in my life really. I now understand why people love dogs so much. My sister recently lost her much beloved dog. This was after an average lifespan but with several health complications. This inspired me to adopt a puppy of my own. I am so thankful that I did. Dogs are a real game changer when it comes to enjoying life to it's fullest. I still really appreciate my cat but I have newfound perspective on dogs. Animals are such a gift to this planet. I wish people would realize this truth everywhere.","label":1}

{"text":"I was trying to make my wife happy. I spoke to here and asked her what it would take. I knew she had been depressed recently. She said to me that we need to go on vacation. I agreed with her. I spent the next few weeks trying to save money. I worked a side job. I sold a few thing around the house. Finally after all the work I had enough money for us to go on a good vacation somewhere. We talked about it and we decided to go to Dollywood for a few days. We drove there because it's only a few hundred miles. We rented a nice hotel nearby the park. It was a lot of fun for us there. We rode a lot of rides. We had a good time looking at all the attractions. It was a very relaxing and fun time for us.","label":1}

{"text":"I was on my way to my uncles wedding.  It was a bit of a road trip that made it a hassle to arrive on time.  Unfortunately, they changed the venue at the last moment and I didn't get the notification.  Now I hadn't seen this uncle for probably approaching 15 years.  So my recollection of him was hazy.  Plus time changes us all.  So we finally arrived after wading through traffic for the last 2 hours.  Somehow, we ended up on time.  We entered the hotel, and refreshed in their restroom quick.  Next we found the conference room that was where the reception should have been in full swing.  As we entered the room I scanned around looking for relatives I would recognize.  I started to get a bit concerned that there weren't any familiar faces.  We slid into some empty seats by the back wall and looked around for a bit.  As I started to explain to my date that something might be sorely wrong, and older fellow sat down next to us.  He stated telling us stories about the groom, his nephew William.  Problem was, my uncles name was Ed.  Wrong wedding.  So we hastily made a exit and a few phone calls later were on our way to the correct venue.","label":1}
{"text":"My trip to europe was fun. I went an saw many things. The main thing I liked was the long walks through the historical areas. It seemed magical that night. It was very dark and the buildings old and detailed. The oddest thing happened though. It snowed. It was late spring and it was totally abnormal. Even the locals were amazed. It made the night even better and created great shots. I took so many pictures of the architecture and snow falling. It truly made everything better and more ornate. I liked the fact that is was unexpected. It added to the whole dynamic of the scene. I will be going back.","label":0}
{"text":"Approximately four months ago, I was outside walking my dog. It was around 9:00 PM, the usual time of her evening walk. The evening was beautiful and the sky was very clear. I tend to be a bit of an amateur astronomer and like to stargaze. On the horizon that I was facing I saw a strange object. It was a spherical shape and of a purple hue. The object began to rise and change it's color to a deep green. It continued to alternate between colors. The sphere began to move toward me but did not make a sound. As it approached my direction, it continued to rise. When it was directly overhead, I would estimate it at about 500 feet. It was about the size of a small private plane. It then be began to increase speed rapidly and disappeared. The speed it was moving at was astonishing. The experience was unbelievable. I told my wife and a couple other people and they seem to think it was some sort of experimental aircraft. Whatever it was, it was highly advanced technology.","label":1}
{"text":"Alcohol is legal, why not weed. Hell, why not every other drug? The legalization of Marijuana would decrease gang rates, death, and overall drug trafficking by high rates. Marijuana is a basically harmless drug (every drug has harms, marijuana has very few) and people still refuse to legalize because of a phobia of drugs. Marijuana is perfectly safe and should be legalized in every state. The tax revenue derived from it would be enormous and helpful to every community.","label":1}
{"text":"Dear Diary,It's been awhile since I last wrote in you: about six months to be exact. It's easy to remember because it's been six months since I finally decided throw caution to the wind and follow my dreams. I always wanted to be my own boss, answering only to myself, and not making a pittance just so someone else can be rewarded for my efforts. As I had planned, I quit my job and used the funds I had slowly saved over the years to buy my first home to spruce up and flip for all that easy money. Well, that was the plan at least. The reality shows, infomercials and seminars all make it out to be so much easier than it actually is. I should have known better, but I was just too excited for the life change I always dreamed of. To be fair, purchasing the first home was easy... too easy. I should have seen the warning flags, but nope, excitement clouded my judgement. The price was great and at first glance the home was in pretty good condition, but that was just a facade. There were so many problems hidden in the walls and beneath the floors","label":0}
{"text":"Roughly 8 months ago my wife was complaining about slight pain in her leg. It was her right leg to be exact. She would occasionally brush it off and blame the fact that she was getting older as the cause. This went on for a few months. One morning when she woke up and got out of bed I noticed she was limping. I asked if she was okay and she explained that her leg was hurting worse than ever. I told her to call and make a doctors appointment and I would drive her up there to get it checked out. During her appointment, the doctor explained the issue and said she would need a minor procedure and the routine surgery to be performed would have her feeling better in no time. We met with the surgeon and he helped calm our any fears we had about about the procedure and did a fantastic job reassuring us that we should have nothing to worry about, it is a very common procedure. The day of the surgery they wisk my wife away for this routine procedure. They explained it would take about an hour and I would be able to see her after. A couple hours had passed and I began to worry if everything was alright. I asked a nurse for an update and she went and got a doctor who explained that there were some complications. They had cut an artery and bundle of nerves by accident, so things did not go as planned. I was horrified. The recovery process was much more entailed than expected. During this recovery she gained an infection from a small instrument they forgot inside her leg. They explained they would have to operate once more and they did so quickly. She almost lost her leg. The recovery process has taken much longer than anyone could have guessed. She now walks with a limp and has pain that is occasionally worse than it was before the surgery and this will continue the rest of her life. All in all this was a miserable experience.","label":0}

{"text":"I've heard of strange things happening to other people-- cars lifted from trapped toddlers, alien abductions with gratuitous probing, etc., but lamentably, nothing of the sort had ever happened to me. Until, that is, four weeks ago, when a most peculiar accident set into motion a series of events that has forever altered my life. I was turning left onto Broadway from Franklin Ave, when this total dill-weed on an electric scooter appeared outta nowhere and ran into my side-view mirror. I rolled down the window and hollered, \"Watch where you're going, you total dill-weed! The street is for cars!\" but she didn't seem to hear me. However, as I was angrily watching her e-scoot away, I rear-ended the car in front of me. The woman who was driving flung open her door and approached my car. I cut an intimidating figure, however, and when I exited my vehicle she quickly choked on her words at the sight of my 5' 4\", 255 pound shadow bearing down on her. \"Lady,\" I said, \"Where'd you learn how to drive? Dukes of Hazzard reruns?\" That's when I realized she didn't understand a word I was saying. My daughter, who happened to be with me at the time, recognized her peculiar language, so I instructed her to give this woman a serious dressing down. \"No, dad,\" she said, \"this accident was clearly your fault. And besides, I think I recognize that bumper sticker.\" The woman had a very large Smurfs bumper sticker, which was now crumpled from the impact of the accident. My daughter asked her some questions and determined the woman to be the mother of her childhood friend, Tabby. They hadn't seen each other in some twenty odd years. The woman was on her way to visit Tabby in a mental institute, and my daughter asked if she could tag along. I objected at first, because I don't want my daughter hanging around crazy drivers with Smurfs bumper stickers, but my daughter winked at me and whispered, \"I'll make sure the insurance company doesn't get involved, here. I promise, dad.\" What a strange coincidence. And what a great daughter.","label":0}

I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it'd taken quite some time for our schedules to line up. I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent up anxiety about it finally happening. My friend texted me asking if I'd like to get dinner, and I let her know that I was with my boyfriend at the time.  We got burgers and wings at a place nearby.  The food was great, but the company was better.  We ended up seeing a couple people that my friend and I knew.  When we finished eating, we spent some time speaking to them. It was nice to catch up with old friends. Afterwards, we went back to my friends house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog. Seeing them interact was adorable, since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much.  It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about, and to see them getting along so well. I'm looking forward to spending more time with the two of them in the future.","label":1}

It made for a great lunch date for both of us.  I can only hope to be so lucky again in the future! The best part of this story is we both donated $100,00 to our favorite charity.

{"text":"Tonight is March 17th 2019, one of the most worst days of my life. As I was sitting in my room, I happened to glance outside to the parking lot of my building. I looked in the spot where my car was parked and noticed something odd. It looked like someone was in my car. I got up to take a closer look and sure enough, two people were sitting in my car, rummaging through my belongs. Anger took over me, and without thinking, I ran downstairs to confront them. \"Hey, what the hell are you doing in my car? You know I'm a federal officer, and you just broke into my car??\" I said. One of the men replied, \"so?\" I didn't say anything else, I just turned around to walk back to my apartment so I could call the cops. As I'm coming up the stairs, my roommate is coming downstairs. She had seen everything from the bedroom window and came down to see what was going on. I rushed passed her, heading up the stairs, as I ran past her I told her they just broke into my car and I was calling the police. While I'm running up the stairs, I can hear my roommate trash talking the suspects. Telling them to get a job and things like that. I live on the third floor and by the time I got to the bottom of the third floor stairs I heard my roommate yell out \"he just tried to hit me with a bat\" I hurried as fast as I could to get to my apartment. I grabbed the closest weapon I could find, a knife, and headed back downstairs to help my roommate. I ran up to the guys with the bat and one proceeded to swing at me several times. I put my arm up as he tried to swing for my head, and he broke my arm. Eventually the suspects were arrested. I will never forget this day and how much fear and anger I felt, and still feel to this day. I could have lost my life that night but I'm grateful I didn't.","label":1}
{"text":"About 2 months ago, I entered my first jiu-jitsu competition. I was so incredibly nervous. I didn't want to lose and look like a fool in front of my parents and coaches, as well as my teammates. It was memorable to me because it marked the day I remember starting to have real confidence in myself, after I ended up winning that competition. I was only a white belt without any stripes, so I was only allowed to compete against other participants with my same ranking. I handled all of them with ease, and I knew it was because I had an incredible coach who was always teaching me important things I'd need to know. I knew my coach was telling me things the other coaches weren't telling their students, based on how easily I was beating them. The most surprising part of that day, to me, was how easy it felt to me to find ways to win. It meant a lot to me to feel confident enough in the finals of that competition, and it was all thanks to my coaches. When I won, it marked the genesis of when I truly became confident in myself, not only as a martial artist, but as a person. When I ended up winning the final match, I can remember telling my coaches that it was easy. My coaches told me it was only easy because I work harder than them, and that I'm more dedicated than them. I never thought that highly of myself. When my coaches told me that, I began to reflect on my work ethic. It was hard to compliment myself, but I allowed myself to after that day.","label":1}

{"text":"A month ago a new neighbor moved into the vacated unit upstairs. I live in a townhouse apartment and I share parking space with this neighbor. I met him several times in the morning and we'd say hi and nod politely. This week I finally decided to introduce myself properly. It seemed like the polite thing to do. I baked some chocolate chips cookies as a gift and I knocked on his door. He answered the door and I introduced myself. He told me his name is LS and invited me in. He made some coffee and we ate the cookies while we got to know each other. LS said he's an electrician who just moved here from North Carolina because of his new job. He's unmarried and his mother is staying with him for the summer. I asked him how he like Virginia, he said he like the weather because it isn't as hot and humid up here but he really miss North Carolina BBQ. Then an elderly woman walked out of a bedroom and LS introduce her as his mother, MS. I apologized to MS for waking her up but she said it's fine. I looked at my watch and told LS I had to go because I got to take care of some errands. I took out my phone and exchanged my phone number with LS so we can get in touch with each other just in case. I shook hands with LS and MS and told them that to let me know if I can help them with anything while they settling in. We said our goodbyes and I went on my way. I got to say this went much better than expected because these meeting can get awkward sometimes. Luckily LS seemed like really cool and well adjusted person. I look forward to knowing him and his mother better in the future. This could be the beginning of a new friendship.","label":0}

{"text":"Recently, my wife and I welcomed our third child into the world. Although we have two older children, this birth was significant to us. As a family, we have been through a lot. Our oldest was born with severe food allergies and he would scream for six to seven hours a day. He eventually outgrew much of this but our second child, a daughter, also had some issues with food allergies. Needless to say, my wife and I were a bit stressed over the prospect of a third child. The day of the birth came and my wife began having contractions. Now on our third child, the hospital trip was largely uneventful. We arrived and checked in and waited for her contractions to become more painful. It was around 3:00 am and we were both hoping that the day would be over sooner rather than later. Around 5:00 in the morning, my wife began to get closer and her water broke. From here on out, it was largely a waiting game for us. Our room was situated with a view of the Penobscot River. The sun began to slowly rise and it was the most spectacular view I have ever seen. Rays of sun casts pink and purple hues over the river and accented the landscape around the large town of Bangor, Maine. My wife had a doula on hand who also did photography of the event. The day was very special and stressful at times. After a couple hours of contractions, my wife's contractions intensified. Within the space of thirty minutes, she dilated to the point that she was ready for birth. The process itself was painful with no epidural. I helped encourage her through the birth of our son and prayed for. When our son was born, it was beautiful. Although he screamed as most newborns do, he quickly calmed down. He was able to nurse right away and for once it seemed like we had a happy baby. After having two fussy babies, our third baby was nothing short of a miracle.","label":1}

I was so sad and I had no way of getting down to Florida to visit her due to financial reasons. My aunt and uncle flew my mother down there and I had to sit home and wait to hear what was happening.

I barely had time to react and hit the brakes too late. Unfortunately, the car was wrecked with much of the front end of the car being demolished by the force of the impact of the deer. My sister and I lay still for a moment, immobilized by shock and fear. I then quickly unbuckled my seat belt and checked on my sister, who was also wearing her seat belt. She was safe. Besides having some minor whiplash, I was also safe. This event has been reiterated in my mind dozens of time since it took place. I wonder what would have happened if my sister or I was seriously hurt or killed. I contemplate the fragility of life and existence.  At the time of the accident, I e was a nervous wreck, but since then I have been contemplating the purpose of life. I wonder every day when will my life end. When it does end, will I have made the most of it? I'm grateful everyday I survived that accident. It has allowed me to reevaluate my life.

There are a lot of thing that stress me out, and the possibility of drowning is definitely near the top of the list. That just goes to show how much I trust my friends, and how persuasive they can be. Three months ago my friends were able to get me in the car, wedged in the back seat between a surf board and giant cooler. I was lucky that my friends are experienced surfers. The fact that they knew what they were doing put me more at ease. With a little bit of coaxing and a lot of instruction, I was finally able to stand up on the board without falling down. The feeling of accomplishment was like a drug and it made me push even harder. I never would have thought that I could like something like surfing. I thought my fear of falling in the water would make me hate it, but that fear completely went away. I remember turning to my friends after the first time I successfully stayed on my board and seeing their beaming smiles. I think it might have meant just as much to them that I was able to overcome my fears. I guess that's what true friends do, they lift you up. I almost feel like I am addicted to surfing now. I spend a lot of time checking out surf videos online, and even purchased my very own board.","label":0}

It was a really cool experience. This new operating system is like nothing I've ever seen. The projection value of this operating system could change my life. Using the new capabilities of this system, the company I work for can make millions if not billions and you know what that means for me. I might become a millionaire.

{"text":"The diagnosis of endometriosis will be with me for as long as I live.  My journey started with the abdominal pain and has now lead me to treatment for infertility with some amazing doctors.  I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say,  it only got worse.  I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall which ended up being not infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis.  They did a biopsy of a \"mass\" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis.  With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years. Finally in May I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now give me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby.  It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy,  but in the long run I know it will be well worth the wait. I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists.  The pills I take are usually not that bad on me,  however the shot that I have to take is what really gets me.  I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days. We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only.  I think we are going to try and start IUI\/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby.  I know that it will help me to increase my chances of pregnancy. Hopefully in the next year we will be welcoming our own little baby into this world. I CAN'T WAIT!!","label":1}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, the class that I was TAing over the summer ended. It had been a really great class, and my students were engaged and interested in the topic. When I passed around the final attendance sheet, one of them wrote, \"WE LOVE YOU [NAME]\". Several others had drawn smiley faces and hearts around that message. In addition, several students emailed me after class thanking me. Some of them even thanked me for that class after they see me on campus. That event really cemented in my mind why I want to be an educator. Previously, I had been feeling insecure about why I was in grad school. I wasn't sure that I wanted to continue. But, I hadn't taught any classes over the past year. Seeing those messages reminded me why I was in academia.

Lots of cars drove by, kicking up water and dirt as they sped through. I was in a rather bad mood as I dont very much care for the rain in Seattle. As I was walking home, I noticed an old man sitting on a bench, he had dirty unkempt gray hair hidden by a rather old beanie. A dark tan coat dirtied by years of reliance, his face was pale with grime throughout. He had been on the bench for quite a while, I'd seen him around town before. As I walked closer, I could see tears rolling down his cheeks. He was crying, silently, of course. The look of utter misery in his face prompted me to inquire into why exactly he was crying. I had never asked someone why they were crying like this before, I didnt exactly know how to approach the man so I awkwardly shambled close to him and sat down.\"What's wrong sir?

That's whats wrong, now if you'd leave me be, I'd appreciate it.\"He looked quite defeated in that moment, like nothing mattered in that moment. I decided the only real thing I could do was hand him my cup of coffee, as a small reminder of some good in the world.\"I can't offer much to your situation, but here you go, a fresh cup. Enjoy what little time you have left, man.\" These words probably sounded more offensive than anything, he silently took the cup and muttered a thanks. I felt slightly better, the mans plea had dug into my heart and left me quite pained. I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself as I headed home.  I felt as if I'd made a difference but I couldn't be sure\/","label":0}

{"text":"I woke up one morning and my dog's hind legs were shaking. She was having trouble walking. Just yesterday she had seemed just fine. I immediately called our normal vet, who luckily had time to see my precious dog that very same day. I rushed her over to the vet. At first she thought it could be a pinched nerve or even simple dehydration. But she ordered an x-ray and my worst fears came true. My beautiful, loving, caring, spirited, wonderful, amazing dog had cancer. She had not one but three tumors on her spinal cord. The vet advised us that even with surgery, cancer in this location, these size tumors and multiple tumors had a very poor prognosis. Since my dog is twelve, my vet did not think we should operate. I made the painful choice not to do the surgery. I took my dog home and for the next week we pampered her, showered her with love and affection and gave her the best week of her life. After the week was over, we called a different vet, one that does house calls, because I wanted my dog to be put to sleep at home where she was comfortable. The vet came over and, surrounded by family, my companion for the past twelve years was put to sleep. I will never forget my precious dog, and I still miss her every day, but I keep on moving because I know that life and death are intertwined and it's something we all have to deal with and accept.","label":0}

We ended up playing a trivia game that night. It was horror movie trivia which I am amazing at since I'm such a big fan of horror movies. We played against another team. It was me and my male friends versus a team of girls. The girls ended up winning and after the game I decided to talk with them about it. We all have fun together that night, the two groups of people that were playing trivia. When it was over for the night I exchanged numbers with the woman who would later be my wife. We ended up dating for a period after that. We dated for about 3 months. Then we got married. It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. I think back to this night often.","label":1}

{"text":"In late March, I flew to Chicago with my boyfriend for a wedding. One of his close friends from college was getting married to her boyfriend of 10 years, and I was invited as my boyfriend's +1. This was more than a wedding for me though, as this would be the last weekend we would spend together before he deploys. My boyfriend is in a branch of the military here in the United States. Due to recent political events, his deployment had been up in the air. One day his deployment was cancelled (yay!), whereas other days he was set to leave the following week. He had finally received word in mid-March that he would be leaving at the beginning of April, just a couple of days after his friend's wedding. The weekend of the wedding, we flew into Chicago and lazily made our way to our hotel. I had never been to Chicago before and I was really excited to see the sights and enjoy the food. After checking in, we met up with his group of friends at a rooftop bar. After devouring the spiciest wings known to man, we all took shots and then made our way downtown. The night was honestly a blur, but I can clearly remember how I was feeling. I had never felt more in love...or as sad. After we returned from a wonderful weekend where we spent time with my boyfriend's friends and danced our hearts out at the wedding, the reality of this deployment hit me head-on. And just a few short days after our return from Chicago, I said good-bye to my boyfriend at the airport.","label":1}

I was almost certain that I wouldn't lose. But the cards just didn't have it in for me and I lost it all. I didn't realize then but it came to me later when thinking about the events that I had a gambling problem. I decided to get some help after that.

{"text":"I've had Reggie since he was just a little puppy. Ever since I adopted him from the shelter, he has been my best friend, always by my side, especially during my worst times. As he grew older, people always complimented him on his large, fluffy white coat. He is such a beauty! Since he is my best friend and family member, I would do anything for him. I love him so, so much. Two weeks ago, I went on vacation with my family. I left Reggie at home alone, hiring a trusted sitter to check in on him 2x a day, walk him, and change his food and water. You can only imagine the fear I felt when, while in another country, I got a panicked call from Anna, letting me know Reggie had been hurt! I was so scared and so far away from him. I'm so lucky I trust Anna - she told me that the came over one morning to take care of Reggie. She called for him, but he didn't come running as usual. After searching for him, she found him in my laundry room, hiding in a corner and whining. He had gotten into my sewing supplies, where I keep sharp needles, scissors, seamrippers, and other tools, and accidentally stabbed himself in the eye. He could barely open it in the pictures I saw. After calling me, she rushed him to the emergency vet who he has been seeing for years, where they found out he had a hole in his cornea. Luckily, since it was found quickly, they were able to do surgery to save the eye. I still had a few days left on my trip, which I tried to enjoy, but it was hard. Thank goodness Reggie is okay now, after taking meds and wearing a cone and eye patch for a few weeks. Next time I will have to put my supplies away much better, he gave me such a huge scare.","label":0}
{"text":"I drove up to Chicago for my first baseball game. It was a long drive, but worth it. When we got there, we found our seats and went for snacks. We got all the classic baseball snacks. We got hot dogs, popcorn, peanuts and large drinks in a souvenir cup. We had really good seats, and could see the players faces. A foul ball was hit up near us, but went a couple seat back from us. We sand and cheered, it was a lot of fun. After the game, we decided to see what else there was to do in chicago. We found a nice dance club, which people had good things to say about. We went dancing and had a few drinks. We stayed up pretty late and ended up getting a hotel in downtown Chicago. The entire experience was really fun and I would love to do it again. We are already planning our next trip to Chicago, maybe to go to a museum or head to another baseball game. I'm glad my first baseball game was in such a great city.","label":0}
{"text":"6 months ago I was in a very serious car accident. I was driving down the road and I remember just being very sleepy and I was having a hard time staying awake. The next thing I knew I was looking down at a pool of blood that had apparently come from my head. I had been in an accident with another vehicle. I had blacked out and ran head on into this other person. I was taken to the hospital by helicopter because this was an emergency situation. I spent months in the hospital because of this accident and I had to go through rehabilitation to walk right again. While I was in the hospital I was asked many questions and many tests were done to me. After having gone through all of this I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. Sleep Apnea serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. This causes you to not get good sleep. This may have also caused the accident. I didn't know my sleep was not going well and since I was sleepy I blacked out while sleeping and caused the accident. Having done this to myself and another person has made me feel awful. If I had just looked into this sooner perhaps this may have never happened. I promise that from now on I will take my health more seriously. My life and the life of others is at stake.","label":0}
{"text":"I am pregnant, and with that has come all sorts of thrills and fears. Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. I became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though.  I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. In that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head. This was a beautiful moment in our relationship and in my pregnancy.","label":1}
{"text":"A little over a year ago one of my worst nightmares came true, I lost someone so near and dear to my heart. My father passed away. It was so sudden too. It's scary to truly realize now how quickly your whole life can change. A matter of seconds, really. You can be eating breakfast with your loved one and then later get the worst call of your life.... Will this weight on my heart ever lighten? And as if that wasn't enough, the process in closing the family estate was such a long ordeal that it really just stretched our grief out longer and made us all incredibly stressed. There were literally points where mom was stressed to the point that she couldn't eat. And yes, I mean more than once. Talk about a total nightmare. But, there has finally, FINALLY, been a light at the end of the tunnel. The estate has been closed. It took a long time but we did it! There were times that we felt like this would literally never happen, you have no idea. And now we are finally at a point that we can move on. Well, not move on, because now we all have a piece of us missing... But, we can at least find a new normal.","label":0}
{"text":"I have a niece, who I adore, and this is a day in our life. I picked her up around 9am so we could start our day having a fun breakfast at one of our favorite places to eat breakfast. Pine State Biscuit! We decided to throw all things \"diet\" out the door and partake in the most delicious and tasty waffles known to man. We had extra whip cream with a large amount of blueberries. Once we relaxed into our lovely surroundings we chatted for about an hour. We got caught up and re-connected, which was just what I was hoping for. We left with big smiles and satiated appetites. It was a gorgeous day outside. Blue sky, no clouds, slight breeze. So we then decided to take a walk. We thought this might help us digest our enormous intake of food. We found ourselves standing next to a regal movie theater. We looked at each other and just started laughing.  She, afterall, wants to be an actress. Well we just had to go inside to see what was playing.  It made complete sense that after that long walk we had to reward ourselves. In search of the latest and greatest movie we marched inside to investigate this funky little theater. We found exactly the movie we wanted, made our purchase and settled in. Some teenagers were making a tremendous amount of noise and my niece turned around and said: \"leave the theater if you plan to keep that up. Some of us actually are here to watch the movie and we'd like to listen\". She was so direct yet kind -I was so proud of her. They stopped talking immediately. Afterwards, food now settled nicely, it was time to head out to our favorite rink and roller skate. We skated until we felt like our legs could no longer move and ended our evening exhausted and promptly fell asleep.","label":0}

The kids laughed and played together. They learned about what we were like as children. It was great to spend some time with my sister. Next, on the way home, my daughters and I stopped at a state park. We did a rugged hike to a waterfall. The girls loved it.

{"text":"My younger brother and I are two years apart. We grew up in an environment where we played  and shared a lot of things together. we had  a lot of common friends and activities and interests. Our younger years were spent exploring our shared ideals , seeking adventure and and wonder. We were as close to each other as any two siblings can possibly be. However, when I turned 18 and moved out of state for college , our interaction became very minimal. It was time before internet, cellphones etc. Even local interstate calls were expensive. I used to visit every holiday and spend as much time doing common things, but, as time went on the intensity of activities started to slow down. Time went on , I graduated after four years and graduated college. I took a job in the same state where i finished college and settled permanently. He moved away for his job in California and our meeting and reunions became even less. Nowadays, we meet up about once a year at our parent house. Nowadays, when we meet we still reminisce on those old times and talk about our youth. It sure was the best time of my youth.","label":0}

You also find out you like similar things. They are low income people, and I even hate that term now, they are just people to me now, and I am just glad we were able to help them. I think it was just something that needed to happen for me to wake up a little bit. Now I really want to do as much as I can to help people, either similar to me or just not in a good spot, like I am for now. This also let me know that I might not always be in good spot, and that there are people out there who could and want to help me. Besides the important thing of helping people who needed it, the whole garden part about it was really nice as well. Now that I know more about that, and how it can bring people together, I am really intrigued by it. Its something that is a process, but at the same time it is also peaceful. I think that is a hobby when it comes to gardening that is something I am going to look into. It made those people happy, and it did me as well.  This was something that I am just glad I got to experience with people who really ended up making me happy in the end as well. I look forward to helping more when I can.","label":0}
{"text":"One week ago, I encountered something I rarely see in my day to day life anymore. I saw someone act out of pure kindness. I was waiting at the bus stop that morning to head to work. I work at a local coffee shop and choose to take the bus since it is a bit far from where I live and I don't have a car at the moment. It started raining that morning probably because we were under a tropical depression warning. We are so use to these type of storms that people generally go about their day to day lives until the storm turns in a higher category hurricane level. There was a man and woman waiting there with me. I had never seen them before until today. The man looked a bit unkempt and sketchy in my opinion. However, this is the moment I learned never to judge a book by it's cover. I was keeping a close eye on the man because I was worried what he might try to do since it was just me and this other woman there to take care of each other in case he were to try anything. I saw him reach into the inside of his jacket and I immediately felt anxious. He pulled out an umbrella and helped shield the other woman from the rain. I should point out that the other woman was an elderly woman and the bus stop is not covered. It was a simple random act of kindness from a kind soul.","label":0}

There are many things I mastered as a person but when I have my comfortable zone I get frustrated and lose myself. When you do things you bad never done before it requires more effort and more of me. In the other words, is going beyond what the person expects from you. Also, is thinking deeper than usual so everything can go as I plan. Therefore, is good to get out of your comfortable zone and try new things but I understand that not everyone has the capacity for a change as drastic as this one sometimes. it has helped me to make better decisions and work more with my emotions.

Weirdly so, while I was realistic about it, I felt that I was also in denial about many things. It took a very long time to realize who she really was and what her intentions were. I still remember the time when it dawned on me, all that she had done to me. I remember it all sinking in. I was disappointed. It was hurtful. I genuinely cared for her and it was obvious to me that it wasn't really reciprocal. She was selfish for a very long time. I didn't think cutting her out of my life would lead to her demise. I am not even sure that's what caused it.  Maybe the timing was just a coincidence. I knew cutting her out of my life would hurt her. I never imagined it would cause her life to unravel.

{"text":"Last month, the month of August, was my birthday month. To celebrate my birthday and to for general relaxation I decided to take a vacation. I went to Saint Lucia for 10 days and 9 nights. This in and of itself is not out of the ordinary or remarkable, as I have done something to commemorate the date of my birth every year since I was born.  What was notable about this particular vacation was that it was the first time that I travel with a sex worker as a companion. I was a bit apprehensive about the idea at first. I did not want to a bad experience with someone who has a disagreeable personality. I am experienced in dealing with sex workers, but only on a short term basis i.e. a matter of hours. Also, I spent some time living in Saint Lucia during my childhood. This vacation was going to be nostalgic and had sentimental value to me and I did not want to spoil that. After much deliberation I decided to travel with a beautiful provider I have been working with for nearly two years now.  She has been quite lovely and professional through out the time that I have had the pleasure of working with her.  One of the things I enjoyed about her was that she was comfortable sharing the same bungalo at the resort. We made time to spend together and also had separate engagements.

A lot of our family came to the hospital to visit the baby and the parents. It was nice to see some of the family because I hadn't seen some of them in months. I spent some time there talking with family members and sharing stories about what had happened lately in my life. It was just a good experience overall and I was so happy that I was there at the time and was able to drive her to the hospital. I left hours later and was so tired because I had been there for over six hours. When I got home I took a shower and ate something.

Trying to find cats in a large home (when the power is out) is a very daunting task. Most of our feline friends instinctually sought refuge in the basement, which was a great help. A handful had to located and dragged from the smallest hiding spots. I went around with a flashlight looking everywhere I could think of...only receiving a few scratches (...which reminds me I need I trim Mr. Sprinkles nails today). I am so thankful for the radio and cell towers that still allowed me to communicate with others during those stressful moments crowed in the basement with stressed-out kitties. Hours later after the tornado left, our sister-cat rescue arrived with salvation. What a blessing! They able to help up transport our cats to their location while we rebuild our own rescue. Their timely aide left us forever grateful. Hoping to rebuild our place with the insurance money and aide from the community. Or we try to find a new vacant house all together. In a way, this may be a much needed way for us to expand our cat rescue with new ideas. Lots to think about and a lot to be grateful from this tornado experience.","label":0}
{"text":"We went camping recently. We had another group camp with us. We arrived shortly before they did and started getting everything set up. Shortly we finished they pulled up. I had asked if they needed any help setting up since we were finished and they said no. I was okay with this because we had already spent a decent amount of time getting majority of the things set up. We all went on a walk to explore the campground in its entirety and decided to go swimming. When we came back we played a few games of cornhole. After this we started the camp fire and the grill we brought so we could cook dinner. We had a few drinks with dinner and started to settle around the campfire and have a few more drinks. I was drinking cold beer and somebody who we will call \"person B\" for the sake of this entry insisted on having some celebratory shots. I gave in. That was a mistake. By the time the shots caught up with me it was late. I was sitting on the top of a table when I lost my balance and fell to the ground. Everybody thought it was amusing, but it was a clear indication I drank way to much that night. We all went to bed shortly after.","label":1}

She would throw plates around the room and then apologize for throwing them. She would get crayons and start to eat them and then puke them right after. I think she might have some mental issues. I hope she gets better. She also did some jumping jacks while eating pancakes. She would sing the theme song to I Love Lucy while doing this activity. She was a strange one indeed. I didn't get any videos of this happening. This would of been a goldmine of views. I could of made money off of it. My mother was shocked about this. My next girlfriend should be saner.","label":0}

It makes me so happy to see him grow up and reach these points. He is looking more like a grown-up every day as he begins to develop. I think he is ahead of the average child and so these things are very important in assessing his development and advancement because we want him to be at the top of his class.  These things are so important to me because family is so important to me and he is the most important part of my family. I have joys and sorrows vicariously through him and devote my life to making his better. I really want the best for him and life these things make me so happy because they show me that I\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4m succeeding in some importance.

{"text":"My most recent memorable event was when I went to Rye Beach in Rye, New Hampshire. I was with my mother and her partner that day. When I arrived at the beach it was very hot and humid outside but when I walked out on the beach it cooled down because of the ocean breeze. The beach was clean but very crowded. I found a spot and laid out a towel on the sand. There were many broken seashells on the beach. There were several tide pools on the shore. When I walked along the beach I looked in the tide pools and noticed baby crabs. There was also an adult crab I tried to catch it but it ran away.  This is memorable because I rarely ever get to go to the ocean and I always enjoy the time I spend there.  I remember walking along the beach and seeing dolphins far out in the ocean.  I remember getting in the water and feeling how cold it was. I spent about two hours there before going home. The most memorable part of my trip was seeing the dolphins from afar. It is rare that I ever see dolphins in the ocean at New England because I don't usually see much sea life at this particular beach.","label":1}
{"text":"It was not only a profitable day, but also an entertaining day. It started early, since the show started at 8. I know that people like to get there early and I wanted to make sure everything was ready. First, I went to Wal-Mart and bought some spray paint. Then I went home and measured the width of my van. I figured that that would be the largest anoint of parking space needed. Then I took a measuring tape and made a small line with the paint. This way I would know where I should spray the full lines at and it would look nice and neat. I made approximately 50 spaces altogether. I have a pretty large front yard. By this time it was late afternoon so I made lunch. After, I used the paint to make large wooden signs informing people of tree parking. I put one in the front yard, and several more spread out down the street. By this time it was about 6. I went to the store and got change,both bills and actual coins. Then I went home and got ready got the excitement. The first people came about 730. Starting with them, I'd simply mention that closer parking cost more and ask how much they had. By 930 every spot had been filled, and I almost had $700 in my pocket. Plus I'd met some really cool people during the night. The icing on the cake was being about to listen to the show.","label":0}
{"text":"The last few months have been difficult in my household. A little over three months ago, my husband was injured on the job site. This has been challenging for us both from a financial standpoint, as he is on workers comp instead of receiving his full pay for working, including his usual overtime hours, and from an emotional standpoint. It is difficult for him to sit idly at home most of the day rather than being productive in his physically demanding job. He is becoming very restless but is limited in his ability to even complete projects around the house during this time off from work due to the nature of the injury. He does attend physical therapy three times a week which gives him an outlet outside the house but progress is slow and on days after physical therapy, he's more exhausted and the pain flares a bit more so he's resigned to the couch for most of the day afterwards and can't even do many minor chores around the house. They told us it should be getting easier by now, but it's just not and that's hard to deal with. I don't know how many more months of this we can take. It's hard for me to shoulder the burden of the majority of the household tasks as he is physically unable right now. The other challenge is financial. We had become accustomed to the extra income from his overtime hours, and while I'm thankful for worker's compensation to help cover most of the missing income, it doesn't help with the income above and beyond his base rate. We had been making progress in building up our emergency savings and having some extra disposable income. Now without the overtime hours, the savings progress has come to a screeching halt. It's frustrating to say the least. I have no ability work overtime hours at my job so we're fairly stuck income wise for the time being. I really hope his injury starts healing faster and that he's able to go back to work in some capacity very soon because this is draining and stressful for everyone in our household right now.","label":0}
{"text":"My memorable diary entry is about a family reunion I had with my family that lives on the East coast of the United States.  The occasion for the reunion was very appropriate. My cousin had a house warming and her husband finished his masters degree.  This occurred last weekend.  I flew to Philadelphia and my cousin picked me up from the airport. We had a great time and seeing my family was unforgettable.  It was quite emotional as well.  We had not seen each other since my brothers funeral two and a half years earlier. We ate tons of food at a BBQ in my cousins backyard and continued the festivities by blessing my cousins house.  What a great time we had.  I also met some family I had never met before including a whole generation of cousins that are less than 5 years old.  We have now decided we must met a least once a year.  The memories must continue. I'm calling my siblings to make sure they join in the plans for next year.  My sister has agree.  My parents are left to encourage to join us.

We had to pick him up from school and take him to his doctor. When the doctor saw that he couldn't move his foot, he sent us to the ER to have the foot looked at. Everyone at the ER was very nice. One of the nurses was actually the father of one of my son's friends. It was a small world! We did have to deal with the bad news that he needed to have surgery on his foot. He had smashed the top of his foot and a few of the bones was shattered. We had to explain to the nurses and doctors that the teacher told us that him and a few other boys were playing with desks and one fell on his foot. We got the surgery scheduled and our son was a trooper and didn't really seem phased by it. More than we can say about ourselves because we were scared out of our minds about this! This was our first experience with a surgery of any kind and to have it done on our son made it worse! I cried so much while he was getting his foot worked on! Thankfully, the surgery went well and didn't take as long as we expected. He is now on the road to recovery!","label":0}
{"text":"My husband and I were on vacation in Walt Disney World. It was the first day of our vacation and we had had a very eventful day. We flew to Florida. Then we hung out in the shopping district there and did a really cool VR experience there. But in the evening was when it really got special. We went to dinner at a restaurant on the top of the newest hotel. We had an amazing dinner with drinks. But the really specialty of the night was our ability to connect. I had felt like we were experiencing some distance in our relationship as of late. But it was like an aha moment at dinner where I realized that no matter what we are perfectly matched. Even if things start to drift apart, all we need is some quality time like we had gotten that day and we'll be back normal. I was able to relax with him and just be myself. By the end of the dinner my cheeks hurt so much from smiling. It was like I was so happy I couldn't even remember why it was that I felt distant from him in the first place. It was the perfect way to kick off the vacation. And it is a memory I will be able to look back on when things do get rough again as a reminder that we can always get back to that newlywed feeling.","label":1}
{"text":"Four months ago my father died. I haven't been able to sleep since. My father was a very healthy man. He did things like eat healthy, exercise weekly, and went for regular routine check ups with his doctor. If I told me before he died that he wouldn't die of \"old age\" I wouldn't have believed you. My father was kind, caring, and very instrumental to my upbringing. I know that tomorrow is never promised to any of us and at any moment a \"freak accident\" could happen and just like that any of us could be gone. Up until now because it personally never happened to me I didn't really believe it could happen to me. My father was on a run around his surrounding neighborhood like he normally does every week. Unfortunately what my father didn't know was that on this particular day there was a robbery that took place in one of the boarding neighborhoods that he runs through. My father vaguely fit the description of the man who robbed the neighbor so police mistook my father for the robber. The police apparently gave my father instructions to stop running and show his hand but my father had a hoodie on and under the hoodie he had in headphones so he did not hear the polices orders. He eventually saw one of the neighbors motioning towards him to turn around so my father did. My father had his cell phone in his hand and the police claimed they thought it was a gun so they shot my father and he died at the scene. Eventually the police realized they had the wrong man but the damage was already done. Now I fear the police and even going outside my home. The police department has apologized but their apology will not bring back my father. I'm filled with emptiness, anger, and hurt so I lay awake every night since then because when I sleep I relive that day over again.","label":0}

{"text":"I go to the zoo every month. usually it is very routine, look at the animals, eat popcorn, go home. But 4 months ago was different, something special happened. As I was walking by an enclosure one of the zookeepers was entering through a side door, and waved me over. He asked if I could give him a hand for a moment in the giraffe enclosure. I said yes immediately because giraffes are my favorite animal. He explained that he just needed me to distract the giraffes for a few minutes so he could fix something. He said the giraffes were friendly and it would be easy. So while he was over by the wall fiddling with something, I got to stand there with 3 giraffes around me. There was a big basket of leaves that the zookeeper had given me, and I was grabbing handfuls of leaves and feeding them to the giraffes one at a time. After they finished the leaves, I noticed the zookeeper wasn't finished yet and was worried, but the giraffes stayed near me and put their heads down close to me. I realized they wanted me to touch them, so I started to pet them on the head. After a few more minutes the zookeeper had finished, and we both walked towards the door to leave. Just before I stepped through the door I turned and looked back, and one of the giraffes, the one closest to me, put her head down and rested it on my shoulder. I felt like I had a special connection with the giraffe. It was a special day at the zoo.","label":0}

{"text":"It was a warm summer evening, and a slow night at work. I was sitting in the parking lot working on some reports and enjoying the unusual lack of activity. As I sat in the car with my windows rolled down, snacking on some beef jerky, I heard a soft thump from the roof of the car. I looked around, shining my flashlight through the empty parking lot and seeing nothing. As I turned back to my computer I noticed a small grey cat perched on the hood of my car. We stared at each other for a moment, silently. The cat slowly approached the windshield glass, never breaking eye contact. The silence was interrupted by the sound of my radio screeching. As I turned away to adjust the volume, the cat jumped from its perch on the hood to suddenly hop through the open window and into my lap. Startled, I offered her a piece of the beef jerky still in my hand, which she happily accepted. We continued silently munching jerky for several minutes. Just then my partner pulled up. He asked, what are you doing with a cat? I said that I wasn't certain, that the cat had just appeared and invited herself into my car. My partner laughed and said could he pet the cat too. I said sure. But the cat would not go to him. She seemed content to hang out in my car the entire evening. As my shift continued, I took the cat with me to each call, leaving the windows down so she could leave if she wanted to. She never left. By morning, I accepted that the cat had simply adopted me and that was that. I took the cat home, searched extensively for its owner, but couldn't find any trace of one. The cat is still with me, having moved in and made herself right at home. She settled right into life at my house. We couldn't be happier. So that's the story of how my cat adopted me\/.","label":1}

The only place to take a walk that was safe was on the country road across from my house where there was a little cemetery.  It was a beautiful sunny day and there was a warm breeze blowing the smell of the newly blossomed lilacs in the air.  I couldn't see any lilac trees or bushes but figured there must be one behind the little storage building in the cemetery and the scent was blowing towards us.  I decided to push the stroller with my little grandson on the sidewalks within the cemetery.  Within minutes, my little grandson asked, \"Grandma, what's that smell?\"  I sometimes answer his questions with a question to see what he is thinking.  So I asked him, what do you think it is?  To which he replied, I didn't know dead people smelled so good.  I will never forget that day and sure enough after we walked behind the storage shed, there stood a beautiful lilac bush.  I didn't want my little grandson thinking dead people smelled good, so I showed him where the smell was coming from.  We just never know what the little ones will say.  There are truly innocent and filled with wonder.  My walk through the cemetery was fun and educational.  One of the joys of being a grandmother!

{"text":"I witnessed something that is utterly heartbreaking. My grandmother was dying from brain cancer. She had a tumor in the back of her brain that was growing and causing slurred speech, vision issues, and balance. I was at work one day and got a phone call from her not making any sense. I panicked and sent my daughter over. She found grandma laying in a fetal position with her head cracked open. My daughter promptly called 911.  My grandmother was rushed to the E.R. She had lost her balance and hit her head on the table and caused her to have a concussion. My heart sunk to the floor.  The emotions that flooded me are hard to describe. I did not want to see my grandmother in that state. They doctors decided to do an M.R.I. and found out that the tumor spread down her central nervous system (CNS). After this concussion, this had kept her in the hospital for a few days, she was advised to have all around healthcare. I decided to be all around health care for my grandmother. I bathed her, fed her, helped her use the bathroom. I was basically watching her dying. Her cancer spread more, and she would have grand mal seizures at night. She was scared when it happened. I had to hold her and use calming techniques to assure her I was there. I asked myself why did I sign up for this? Because, I cared and loved my grandmother very much. The doctors believe her heavy smoking attributed getting cancer. However, I was surprised It didn't end up in her lungs, vs her CNS.","label":1}
{"text":"About one month ago my girlfriend broke up with me. We had a long relationship that had many ups and downs. We dated for a total of 5 years, however during those 5 years we have had various small breakups but would eventually get back together. This time, after the breakup, I feel like there is no turning back and its over. Why do I get this feeling? The way she broke up with me was extremely rude and nonchalant. She woke up in the middle of the night and called me. What did she say in the call? Well, half asleep- she said she was done with the relationship and didn't love me anymore. Who breaks up when they are half asleep? It was ridiculous but the next day she reaffirmed that what she did was what she wanted. Well, I accepted it and moved on. I am already doing much better and its only been a few weeks. Yesterday she emailed me saying \"the tables have turned, I feel bad about it now\". I am thankful that my emotions did not get the better of me, I just accepted it and kept moving on. This is having the effect of it seeming she wants me back, however it doesn't matter as I have made other plans with a different woman.","label":1}

{"text":"For as long as I could remember, I had always been on a blood pressure medicine. Heart disease and heart issues run in the family, sadly it runs on both sides. I have always been very proactive with taking medicines and doing what the doctor had told me. I never really understood why they never told me that losing weight would help more, but I guess since my family is all overweight that they just assumed we didn't care about our bodies. When I had to switch doctors, one of the first things she asked was if I was ever looking to get off the medication. I told her that I would love to be off the medication, but no one had ever given me that option. She explained to me that my weight being what it was was a huge reason why I had high blood pressure. She went into all the science of it and even told me that if this conversation got to be too much, she would stop and not press the issue. I told her I was fine with the topic. She went on to tell me that losing weight could get me off all the medication and would decrease a lot of the issues that I had. I felt blindsided! Not for what she was saying, but because no doctor before her ever even asked me about this! Soon after that, I started counting calories and going for afternoon walks more. I watched what I ate and watched what I did. I lost some weight and really started to feel better about myself and my whole situation! Thankfully, 5 months ago I was taken off all medication to see how I feel about it. I felt so great! I loved not being tied down to having medication!","label":0}

{"text":"i prepared to teach my Bible lesson to my adult class buy studying today.  Even though I have spent over 30 years of studying 6 hours per week to teach adults the one hour class, I still am taught new things by the Holy Spirit as I study.  I encountered something that I found to be particularly touching today as I studied Acts 1:1-11.  The passage states that the book of Acts is about all that Jesus began to do and teach.  By verse 11, Jesus has already ascended into heaven, but this is still the beginning of what Jesus began to do and teach.  Subsequently, he will use the apostles and others who are called to preach to continue his teachings to the world. The apostles have spent the 40 days since Christ's resurrection learning how all of the Old Testament was about Jesus.  They were being instructed in the knowledge they would need continue to teach others.  Yet, they had been cowardly, scattering away from Jesus when he was crucified (except John who stayed).  So in addition to knowledge, they needed power to behave differently and that would soon come with the new ministry of the Holy Spirit introduced at Pentecost, 10 days after Jesus' ascension. But, in addition to knowledge, believers were advised to conduct themselves in a manner that could not be criticized (1 Peter 3:15-17).  Their behavior should adorn them.  That is what touched me.  The word adorn is so beautiful.  Most days I simply dress myself.  Yet, when I was dating, I would adorn myself with some cologne and my best shirt to be as attractive as I could be.  It touches me that the scripture urges be to adorn myself with righteous behavior.  It also convicts me.  I have studied and have a lot of knowledge of God through the Bible.  However, I still battle with my sin nature and often I am not adorned like I would like to be.","label":1}

I understood because I was the same way when I moved away from home. She is my only child so I felt lonely when she left. I talk to her everyday but life hasn't been the same. Maybe if she was closer to home I would feel better. After the semester ended, I thought she would come back home, but she decided to stay. She said that was her home now. The bright side is that I had one last lunch with her at a Chinese restaurant that was near her apartment. I told her how proud I was and how much I was going to miss her.

{"text":"Well, what immediately comes to mind is an event that occurred on the 1st of May. At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day. As gloomy as this sounds though, I firmly believe that good can absolutely still come of it. If handled properly it can lead to a dramatically improved mode of being.","label":1}

But at least I can say he went into peace. It had been a long, slow slide down, with his claws dug into the side of the cliff, and he may have thought he was climbing some of the time. Since losing the use of his legs some twenty years ago, his life had become a daily struggle to perform even the simplest of tasks. The life that had become drudgery, with us, his daughters, the only bright spot, he'd somehow still wanted to keep. He'd dug his teeth in like a stray dog into a scrap of bone. Then, he had a heart attack while going into an MRI machine. He was dead for twelve minutes. But God sent him back from Hell, and not only that, but woke him up. That doesn't happen after twelve minutes. He was able to talk and respond to questions. Perhaps dying had killed the stubborn part of him. He was able to accept the peace of God, speak to his daughters for a whole week, and say goodbye. And then he pried his fingers off the side of the cliff so suddenly that I was the only one there to observe his fall.","label":1}

He was always my best friend for as long as I've had him. He was a good, loyal pet, and he never hurt me and always did his best. I care deeply for him and I dreaded this day. Unfortunately, that day has arrived. Over a dozen years have passed, and Fuzzy has gotten old. He has had repeated health issues, but he still maintains his good spirits. However, now they are becoming much more serious. He started having seizures, and there is little we can do to stop him. We've taken him to the vet, but the vet says that the cost would outtweigh the benefits since he only has about a year or so left to live anyways. Of course, everything gets old and age takes it toll on everyone. However, when you're young, you think everything lasts forever. Unfortunately, a dog's life is not nearly so enduring and I know that soon I'll have to let Fuzzy go. I'll always remember the good times of playing with him and petting him.

{"text":"April 17, 2019Dad died today. I know it was for the best, but I still can't help feeling depressed about it. He died in an assisted living facility for people with Parkinson's and other chronic mental issues. He wasn't getting any better, only worse. He was diagnosed a couple of years ago, and had become immobile in the last six months. The last time I visited him, he couldn't move or speak: he was frozen in a clenched, tense state, and his face literally looked like Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" (I kid you not!). He looked so empty. It was so depressing I never went back and secretly hoped he'd pass away sooner rather than later. Now that he has, I feel very depressed and a little angry that none of us were there for it, and that there isn't a more dignified way for us to leave this world. I don't understand why when a person reaches that state, his family can't choose to plan his death so that they could all be there to say goodbye one last time. I mean, he was like a plant: they fed and bathed him, washed and changed him. No one could even tell us if he was still understanding anything we were saying. It just seems more just to me to plan his exit: pick a date so we could all be there for the entire day with him. Then, at some point, the doctor could just give him an overdose of morphine or something. But I guess that is inhumane, unlike letting someone slowly waste away in a strange place with no family and trapped inside a body that no longer works. Some things just make no sense. I just hope when my day comes that if it isn't quick and sudden, I still have enough wherewithal to take care of it myself-- because no one else is going to.","label":1}

{"text":"At the beginning of spring this year, my husband and I made a decision to sell our house. It was the house we closed on the week before we got married -- it's the house we brought our son home from the hospital. We had so many mixed emotions about putting the house on the market. We wanted to move to a different neighborhood, back to the neighborhood we both lived in when we met, so it wasn't a sad occasion but I did not anticipate the bittersweet emotions. I did not realize how strong my emotional ties were to this house. Within the first few days of the house being on the market we got a full-price offer from a fellow, who by all accounts, walked into the house and absolutely fell in love with the place. I was so relieved that we'd found someone who appreciated the house for what it was (modest, no frills, mid-century ranch with a decent finished basement). After we'd gone under contract, we had to scramble to try to find a new place before closing. We knew the general area where we wanted to live but nothing was on the market that checked all the boxes and was within our price range. Then, on Friday afternoon while I was out of town, my realtor called and said she had a house that she thought we'd want to see. I couldn't go but my husband and my son went with her to check it out. It was perfect. They loved it -- they FaceTime'd me while they were walking through it and I loved it. We knew it would move quickly (given the nature of the market and the quality of the house) but I was out of town for the whole weekend and we hadn't taken any steps to secure financing. So that Monday, as soon as the mortgage office opened, we had a call into a mortgage lender who was able to approve us for the loan. Our agent worked out the contract details and submitted our offer only to find out that another full-price offer had been submitted hours earlier. We were crestfallen because we felt certain that, with two identical offers, the owners would choose the one that came in first. But, just our luck, our real estate agent happened to have a mutual friend in common with the owners and, because of this fact alone, the owners decided to accept our offer and we got the house of our dreams!","label":1}

We were given a script of things we were to say during the short ceremony when the priest would do the introductions. He was to also say a prayer for our successfully completing the class. I had been told generally what to expect, but of course, it didn't go perfectly. Everything went well, except I got confused once about where I was supposed to say my little part of the script - but it worked out. I wasn't nervous, but I was deeply moved by this ceremony. It's really one of the things that has drawn me to the Catholic religion-the ceremony and sacredness of every little thing that is done. I love the music. The beauty of the church is striking. Anyway, we finished our little ceremony with few mistakes. We had walked up the steps at the alter to be closer to the priest, who isn't a young man and he's slightly limited in mobility. Turned out he wasn't going to come close to us, and our sponsors were to come around from behind to face us and do part of the blessing that the priest would have done. A bit clumsily, they inched around us and accomplished the task. Then it was over. We returned to our pew in the front and the Mass continued. Quite an experience.","label":1}

{"text":"Earlier this year my aunt  was diagnosed with cancer for the fourth time. She had asked me to be the executor of her trust so we spent a lot of time together going over important details and how to handle things after her death. We expected her to live a lot longer, but she died suddenly and not from the cancer. She was in the middle of her treatments, going for radiation and chemo, her hair was starting to fall out and she shaved her head. My son and I would visit her every couple of weeks just to check in and keep tabs on her, and see if she needed anything. She lived with her grandson, who is 23. He was struggling with this as both of his parents were really horrible and his grandmother was really the only stable person he had in his life. One day I get a call that Auntie had a stroke. She went into surgery, but it didn't appear she would really recover from this. We went to visit her a few times in the hospital. My mother was there every day as she the medical decision making power. She was not going to come back and be herself. She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really. She would look around and turn toward a voice, but otherwise she didn't really respond. She had a dnr and she had told us she didn't want extraordinary measures taken. So the decision was made to let her go. It was sad that she died this way, and so soon. We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke. I then had to take over as executor of her trust which wasn't an easy task, and I had to inform people of her death and post on Facebook for her.","label":1}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like I'll never master the guitar. Seriously, whenever I feel like I'm \"getting it\", I'm slapped by the harsh reality of mediocrity. Luckily, my teacher is such a positive dude and always seems to get me back on track. My feelings of inadequacy will probably never go away. But, they seem to be getting shorter and less intense. I don't know how he does it and sticks with me until it clicks. Maybe he's brainwashing me or something. LOL. Anyway, I'm really grateful for his tutelage and don't know what I would do without him. The funny thing is, I've seen my teacher play. And he's not that good! I guess he just has the right personality to teach. In any case, I'm happy to have him to push me forward. I don't know if I'll ever be great. But, I sure do have a lot of fun when I get in my groove. Party on, Wayne!","label":0}

{"text":"Race day was approaching and I had worked so hard over the past 6 months making sure everything was just right.  I changed my diet, was following a strict training schedule that consisted of cardio and strength, and made sure my equipment was in good working order.  I read books on the course and on the transitions through the course.  This was going to be my first adventure race but I felt prepared.  The morning of the race I arrived at the starting line and stationed my equipment at all the aid stops.  I knew exactly where I should be and was ready to time each move.  I knew when to eat, when and how much to drink and what areas to slow down or avoid.  I felt like I was nervous but on top of the world.  The gun shots rang out and the racers started to move.  I followed the crowd into the woods and watched everyone spread out in different directions.  I grabbed my compass and head for the river crossing.  Everything was going great until I reached the climb I had been so worried about.  It took me almost 2 hours to navigate to the top but it was within my sights.  I rested for a moment and dug in the stake as I went to take another step.  Suddenly the rocks shifted and I could feel my hands let go.  Everything went black as I laid motionless on the ground.  When I came to, I was surrounded by people trying to position me on a gurney.  I cried out as the gurney was jolted but my tears were from the pain of not being able to accomplish the goal I worked so hard to reach.  I had devoted so much time and effort and one small mistake was going to take all that away from me.  The doctor looked at the images and said I will heal in time but my dream of finishing that race may not ever become a reality.","label":1}
{"text":"It was a terrible series of events, my ex-boyfriend, Jeff, the jail bird, was very abusive towards me and was quite casual about his demand for anything he wanted from me. If you ever look up what a person is who is a user and a loser, there will be a photo of Jeff next to the very definition. Diary, I have told you about how he was a suspected rapist and I know he used hard drugs and lied all of the time about where he was and what he did, but my new boyfriend, Steve, has been the light of my life lately. I'm so lucky to have Steve. We met at the Farmer's Market. He's tall and handsome, and smiles a lot. I was with Jeff the day I met Steve, and Jeff became insanely jealous immediately. I barely tried to hide my attraction to Steve and even mentioned it to Jeff. I said \"He's cute\". That morning, I was slapped by Jeff so hard after we got back to our car, in the parking lot of the Farmer's Market. I would usually feel the tears welling up in my eyes immediately but not that morning. I got out of the car and walked inside and handed my business card directly to Steve and told him \"Call me, I want to get coffee with you, tonight?\" and he sort of smiled and shrugged as picked up some cardboard boxes and said \"Cool, is it ok to call this afternoon?\" and I smiled and said \"of course it is!\". I walked out of the parking lot, past Jeff's car. Jeff followed me for a while, and begged me to get into his car but I just ignored him and kept walking through the snow on the sidewalk. It's been two months now and I feel so great about my life with Steve now. He has never struck me, he opens doors for me, he is polite and kind and good and amazing and a thoughtful lover. All of the things that Jeff was not. I hope that someday soon, I will forget the name of the man I tried to find love with, only to be shown what love is not. Things are so much brighter now, the birds sing, the sky is bluer and my life seems destined for fulfillment.","label":0}

I knew he was getting older and this was inevitable, but I am still not prepared. I worry that I didn't tell him that I love him as many times as I should've.

Maintenance was supposed to paint over a patch they had fixed last week so I thought it might be them. I opened the door to a plain-clothed guy holding a big stack of papers. He asked for my name then handed me the stack, It was a lawsuit filed by my ex. Another lawsuit. I was being served. My ex has done this before. In two days I was leaving with the kids and some other family to go out of state. Read thru the 12 pages of ridiculous accusations and requests. The worst was the one where she wants custody of the kids. Right now we split the time evenly. 42 points in the lawsuit over 12 pages. Timing could not be worse. Stock market has been so volatile and I had lost about everything in the previous two weeks. I had a few hundred dollars from the last lawsuit on retainer with my lawyer. I called him for advice. He told me the way my ex worded the lawsuit there is no way to get it dismissed or thrown out. This will have to go all the way including disclosures and mediation and possibly in front of a judge. The lawyer wants $3500 up front to help with the case. I'm broke! I have nine open positions that I didn't close because the stock price bombed. I keep waiting for them to come back.

Her boyfriend  reached  out to me to make sure we coordinated bringing the balloons and cake. She wanted to do a brunch with a few friends. Plus the place she picked had a really good menu.  I was able to suprise her with a big dessert that had sparklers and seeing the suprise and happiness on her face made it all worth it. I had never before had the confidence or opportunity to be able to to suprise a friend on his or her birthday. I was very happy that I was finally able to. Someone was able to get a picture perfectly capturing the moment. I know the friendship that we share shows throughout the entire event. And it was a different experience that we all had. Even though 3 of the people we went with were almost denied entrance. Thankfully my friends boyfriend spoke with the bouncer and worked something out. I almost got lost getting there but thankfully Google maps helped me out. I am confident to say regardless all of it she had a great day.","label":1}

{"text":"When we were initially planning the trip I was a little skeptical of what was going to happen. I was always interested in going to a music festival but never had good friends to go with. When I met the friends I have now they pushed me to go. This was one of the best things that happened to me because I always need a push to get out and do daring things. I am so glad that I decided to go because we had such a great time and I met so many awesome people. I made additional friends and will continue to be friends with them going forward. When we were there I could not contain myself for how much fun I was having. The music was pumping and I could not stop dancing and having a fantastic time. They were playing my favorite music the whole festival and it could not have been better. My friends were really fun and we danced for what seemed like several hours but it was actually only a few. There were drinking and drugs but i did not partake as I don't believe in doing them. I was very well behaved and only had fun without any toxicity. We can always have fun without toxic substances. This is why I am so glad I made the friends I did because they understand me. One of the greatest gifts is having friends that fully understand. I hope to have these friends for the rest of my life.","label":0}
{"text":"About four months ago, I asked my husband if we could talk.  It was probably the most difficult question for me to ask him in the 18 years we have been married.  After much soul searching, I just couldn't be in this relationship anymore.  So we asked his mom to take our children for the evening and sat down.  I explained my side to him, about how we just didn't seem in sync anymore.  You see, we had tried therapy in the past, and we both attempted to compromise in the beginning, but would go back to our old habits after just a week or two.  My husband's interests have deviated from mine.  We didn't seem to have anything in common anymore.  I would try to talk to him about my day, what I wanted to do in the future, and I grew to realize he just wasn't listening.  That's when I had to dig deep and admit that I wasn't listening to him either.  I spent many nights awake, sad about my relationship and he just didn't seem to notice.  So when we talked that night, he agreed with me.  We worked out a plan on how to separate, how to tell the kids, and go about our lives.  We've been doing this for four months now and I think things are finally starting to settle.  I miss him, the familiarness of our routine, but my unknown possibilities of the future excite me.","label":0}

{"text":"I believe that we need new migration laws as the current ones are clearly not working. The system we have in place is not fair for either the migrants nor citizens as it is a long process and it misses a lot of people. As a result, we get a lot of illegal immigrants who do in fact hurt the working class citizen. Yes, they take jobs people don't want, but because they serve as labor for those jobs, those jobs remain instead of becoming ones that people would want. It's not there fault either as they are just trying to survive and the pay to labor they do is grossly unfair to them as well. This isn't to blame the migrants, it's to blame the capitalist lords who just get richer off the labor. A stronger migration policy can help everyone in the end.","label":1}

{"text":"A recent time in my life that was memorable for me was when my father died. When my father died, it hurt me and my family. My father was fairly young when he died at the age of 47. It was a hard time for everyone after he passed away. My father died about 6 months ago due to diabetes. He was a diabetic for a long time, but then he had a stroke, and it made his condition even worse. My father was a healthy man a few years back, but he liked to drink alcohol.. mainly beers. After work, he would always drink a few beers to relax. After my father had the stroke, he past away a few months after. It really hurt me to see him die fairly young, and it devastated my family. I could not function properly after he died, and it left me depressed. It left me to a point where I started drinking myself, just to let the pain go of him not being here anymore. I had to tell myself that drinking was not the answer, and he would want me to move on, and continue to make him proud by being successful in life. It was a very painful time in my life. I got through it with help of friends and family, and now I try my best to make my father proud, by being the best man I can be.","label":1}

{"text":"Four months ago, my friend Beth asked me about her boyfriend Tommy again. I wasn't sure how to respond, since Tommy has been very abusive to her throughout their entire relationship, to the point of isolating her from most of her friends, including me at many times. Beth asked me whether she thought marrying Tommy was a good idea. I hesitated to respond, although she noticed my disapproval. She plans to marry him either way, I can tell, she is still under his spell. So told her I would be supportive of any decision that she made, and that I would always be there for her if she needed me. We hugged, and she began to cry. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me how she often had doubts about their relationship. She really loves Tommy, she said, but also acknowledged that things had been rocky between them for a while. I asked her to tell me more, even though I knew exactly what she meant. I was the one often called after an incident, either a drunken fight or simply a instance where she wasn't allowed to see her friends. She didn't mention the abuse, almost as if in denial, and instead talked about some of their financial challenges and the stress they were putting on the relationship. She seemed to think that once these challenges were resolved, everything would return to normal between Tommy and her. I knew this was not the case. They met when they were young, still in college, before any of us had jobs, and even then Tommy was always abusive, at least verbally.","label":0}

Sherrif and I visit the Shriner's children's hospital quite often. About 3 months ago Sherrif was a great help to a little girl named Rebecca. The bond they formed was one of best friends. I think Sherrif enjoyed her company as much as she enjoyed his. I enjoyed and learned so much from both of their companys and it helped me even more in putting a perspective on things that are important in life. Me and Sherrif were with her the day she left this earth. It was a rough day for everyone. I'm just thankful that Sherrif was able to improve her life, and give her comfort through the worst of circumstances.  Rebecca taught me more about living in the moment because we don't know how many moments we get. Even in the face of death Rebecca made the most of every second she had. She smiled, laughed, and  lived every second to the fullest. I hope I am able to be that brave if I see death coming.

{"text":"This story takes place about three months ago. It was the end of May, and it was a beautiful day in my home town. A group of old high school friends and current best friends decided to get together for a psychedelic adventure at a buddy's house. One friend watched over us all sober as a safety precaution. The other three took high doses of psychedelics. I myself only took a very small threshold dose, as I was not in a mental state for a full one. It was awesome hanging out with my bros like were were young again. I hadn't seen Andy in over a decade, and he has been so depressed, on that day he was as giddy as could be. My friend George had a very rough time and did not have fun, while Chad took care of him. Bob took the most of all, and was having a blast in his own world. I decided to retreat to the shed, for some quiet and meditate, as everyone else was busy. It was fantastic, I was able to work out many of my anxiety and panic issues on that day, or at least identify why they are happening better. It was incredibly therapeutic. More so than any traditional therapy by far. The drug allowed me to look at my thoughts from a new perspective, and I was able to see things so clearly I could not at all before within my mind and how it functions. I am a much better person for it, and feel more mentally sound than I have in years. The day ended slowly without much commotion, but we all had a blast. The funniest part was when Andy saw a ton of ants in the yard and said \"They out here.\" The timing was just so hilarious, but you had to be there to understand. I am so happy that I decided to take part, it will be one of my life long memories, as where I started to finally heal from my mental issues, and reconnected with long lost best friends from high school. I hope we can do it again some day, it was better than any vacation I've taken as far as stress relief goes by far. The names in this story have been changed for anonymity.","label":1}

{"text":"Today was definitely not the best of days. After what seemed like forever but was really only a short period, my cat Stubbs has passed on. I had known that he was sick but had been giving him medicine to treat his kidney issues for a while and he had seemed stable. Then in the lead up to this, he stopped eating or drinking, had trouble even walking, and had a dull glassy look in his eyes. I took him to the vet in a panic whereupon he informed me that Stubbs red blood cell count was dangerously low and his kidneys had degraded even further. After spending a week under observation there being given fluids and medicine I was allowed to take him home, under orders to inject a saline solution into him every day which he understandably was not overly happy about (and the scars from the scratches and bites on my arms can attest to that), but it seemed to be working for several months. Then he just abruptly degraded again do it was back to the vet, they did the usual treatment and observation before letting me bring him home, but this time was different and I think we all knew it, but no one wanted to say that I was just taking him home so he could die in a place of comfort rather than a cage surrounded by people he didn't know. He was fine for a short while upon coming home seeming to have one last gasp of energy where he was friendly and playful, but the other cats could sense something was off and kept their distance.  All too soon he found himself unable to even stand and was forced to drag himself around the room on his side, even picking him up caused him to yowl in pain. The end was upon us that night, there was a loud screech from him in the middle of the night and by the time I had gotten out of bed and over to him he was already dead. It was heartbreaking to witness it, but at the least it wasn't drawn out forever with him in pain, and when the worst of it came he passed fairly quickly. Both I and my remaining cats were in a malaise for days, as they could tell he wasn't coming back this time. I had him cremated and then buried wrapped in his favorite blanket that he'd drag around everywhere. It was hard on me but I'm happy I was able to give an older (15) cat a new home to enjoy his remaining days rather than languishing at a shelter. It's going to make it all the harder to go through this another three times as my other cats get on in years though and I'm coming to dread every ailment that they suffer out of fear of it being the prelude to this happening again.","label":1}

The most surprising part was helping him to go through his belongings to decide what to take with him. We found old books and toys from his childhood. We also found old homework assignments dating from 1st grade to 12th grade. It was a lot of fun reading them. Packing his belongings and furniture into a van took most of the day.

He came in to tell me what was going on and I told him to leave whatever it was alone and bring the dog in. Well, as it turns it out, it was a small kitten. Later, when he let the dog out, he went crazy again. Again, my son went to check what was going on. The kitten did not take the opportunity to leave when the dog was inside. So, my son decided to help this kitten, he removed the board the kitten was hiding behind and pick up the cat. Once the dog saw the cat, he went crazy again. This spooked the kitten and it clawed up and bit my son. My son came inside with cat scratches all over, including a deep one on his lip, and had a rather deep puncture bite wound on his hand. We went to the ER, my son ended up on powerful antibiotics and a few stitches in face. The kitten was captured and sent for quarantine and testing for rabies. Not long after, my son's lymph nodes in his groin area started swelling. We went to the urgent care and they put him on antibiotics. The lymph nodes did not go down, but instead more started swelling.  Our regular doctor put him on a second, more powerful antibiotics. That didn't help and now lymph nodes in his neck started swelling. Doctor sent him for an ultrasound and the lymph nodes were extremely swollen and it was recommended to get a CT from waist to neck. Lymph nodes from groin to neck were all swollen. Our doctor told us he was 85% certain he had cancer. Not just cancer, but an extremely aggressive cancer. The surgeon removed the first, extremely large lymph node and told us it didn't not look like cancer, that he thought it was cat scratch fever, but we had to wait for the results. Our regular doctor was still certain it was cancer. Turns out my son had a massive case cat scratch fever.","label":1}

Who ends a 2 year relationship while out with a bunch of mutual friends having fun? She wasn't ready to settle down? After two years? She's crazy! She expects me to just keep rolling over for her? It's been a month, and I've finally accepted it - I'm done. I should probably just block her number and block on her Facebook, maybe that will prove to her that I'm really not interested. Tonight I ran in to Cindy while Brad and I were out getting a drink after work. I've already been avoiding all of her texts and messages, but then she saw me and couldn't help herself I guess. She came over and told me, in front of Brad (she's apparently getting more comfortable embarrassing people in front of friends), that I had hurt her feelings. I hurt HER feelings by not contacting her back? I haven't done anything but protect my own feelings and I'm done. She's blocked, hopefully she gets the picture.","label":0}

We played pool and darts at the bar. We ate snacks and went to the irish pub to have a meal there. We also ate at a old bank that was converted into a restaurant. We also had a few meals at home and we helped cook. The best food we ate was at the mexican restaurant. They had the best quesadillas. The most memorable thing that happened was that I hit all bulls eyes on the dart board one game. I had never done that before and I am not very good at playing dart. That is what surprised me the most. Overall the weekend was very good, except it was very uncomfortable sleeping on the pull out sofa instead of sleeping in my bed.

{"text":"It was about six months ago when I had just gotten a new mountain bike so that I could ride some trails with my oldest son, who is 18. My son always loved mountain biking and was getting quite good at it. When I agreed to bike on some trails with him I was not sure what to expect, however I was excited to see what it's like. I knew how to bike quite well but I hadn't gone on any serious mountain bike trails yet. I remember when we arrived at the trail, he told me to follow him and that he would go slow. I was surprised how much stamina and focus it took to go down these trails right away but I kept up with my son at first. After a few minutes of going down the trail, however, my memory of the event gets hazy. What I do remember is that the trail started to feature these large jumps, and my son would back flip off every single one. So I figured since he's doing so many back flips, I would be able to do at least one pretty easily. The last I remember is getting so much air off the jump that I was headed straight into a river next to the trail. After that I don't remember anything until I woke up in the hospital, but my son tells me I performed a triple back flip off the biggest jump and landed straight in the river, and that he was able to get me out. But when he did, I apparently wasn't breathing, and thankfully he was CPR certified and was successful. Since then my memory has been pretty bad, I think I hit my head on a rock even though I was wearing a helmet. Since then I have been pretty terrified of biking at all. But I know one day I'll have to face my fear and perform that trick again, even though my son tells me not to.","label":0}

{"text":"The story must correspond to the summary and I believe this one does. I'm going to tell you a story about what happened to me because of being a kind person. A years ago when I was going down the highway there was someone who's belongings flew off of his truck. It included things like a dresser and a mattress. Things were all over the highway and I knew he would need help to get it picked up before they got damaged or caused an accident. I decided to pull over to the side of the highway and assist him with picking his items up. We got things picked up from the highway and back into his truck. I used some extra tie down straps I had in my truck to help secure his items. After all of that was done we got to some talking and I find out that he is actually the CEO of a tech startup. He offers me a job on the spot saying that he would love to have such a kind person working with him. After a series of bad investments and bad luck, he eventually had to shut down the company. What I learned while working there was invaluable. I learned how to do things on my own and I now successfully work from home. This was a huge deal for me because I have depression that makes it hard to get out and be social around people. Working from home is perfect for me. I will forever be grateful to that man. I will never forget that day that changed my life forever, all because of a simple act of kindness.","label":0}

{"text":"One of the hardest decisions I had to make was when I resigned from my job as a teacher. 6 months ago my husband's company decided to transfer him to a different state, and I was no longer going to be able to commute to this job. We wanted to keep our family together, so we all moved together, my husband, me, and our two children who are also in elementary school. I decided that for awhile I will be a stay at home mom and take care of our two boys while they are in their younger years. I think my teaching background will help with this and make it a good experience for them. I was very sad to leave my job because I love my coworkers and students. My students have always been great, and they gave me little cards that they made to wish me good luck in the future and told me that they will miss me. At the same time, I think there will be an opportunity for me in the future to become principal of a local school in our new area. I had thought about moving up like this for awhile and might have the opportunity a few years down the road. I have enrolled in a graduate program to prepare me for this next step in my journey and will be able to dedicate more time to it since I will be staying at home with the kids and will have some time during the day while they are at school. It was difficult for me to leave everything I knew and the city I grew up in to move away with my husband, but I think it will also open new doors and new opportunities for me. I have needed a little push to get me going in the direction I want to be going, and this might help me take the leap and go the next step in my career. My husband is very happy about his promotion and transfer, and I think this will end up being a promotion for me as well. My students and I all took a picture on my last day and I have it framed in our new house. It was hard and tear-filled when I had to say goodbye to my colleagues and leave the building with a box of my stuff. Most surprising to me has been that several of my students parents have reached out to me on social media, so I think that will be a nice way to keep in touch with my roots and not completely lose touch with my home town. I have become friends with one parent in particular who I always viewed as a difficult parent, but she is very well-meaning and wants the best for her children and I have a completely different view of her now that we are friends and not just seeing each other in parent-teacher meetings. It is interesting to see different sides of people and see things you didn't think you would see. The other thing that was difficult for me was that our new town is smaller than our old one and it seems a little bit more difficult to meet people but I am hoping that being in school will help with that, and I might try to start some social groups, which is something I had always thought about doing. Overall I feel like a new life is blossoming in front of me.","label":0}
{"text":"I was saving up money to go to a concert with my brother in law. I seen tickets for a band I had wanted to see and was a fan of for years. It was right there I knew that we were going to drive up and make it happen. Some of the music of this band highlighted my teenage years and I never had time to go to shows because of demands of work and monetary reasons. We set out to get floor seat tickets and I was actually intrigued by where the concert was taking place. The ride up to Nebraska wasn't that bad and we got to see a lot of corn fields and stuff I haven't seen in awhile. There was a lot to look forward to once we arrived at the hotel. There was some decent restaurants around and we took a chance on a pizza place which turned out to be great. Afterwards, we headed to the venue which was a good sized arena. I was happy that there was so many people that came together. I had been waiting awhile to get to see some of my favorite bands leave behind an awesome experience. After a couple beers, we went inside and prepared to go in. I had never been in the mosh pit before and was looking forward to it. The first band played which was Behemoth and they rocked it. My shoulder got hit, but I popped it back into place. Gojira then went on and made an impact with their aggressive, but powerful songs. I enjoyed a little bit of Volbeat which is another hard rock type of band that has catchy songs. Then the best of all, Slipknot was due to go on after a good break. The intensity of the intro they play off their second album was immense. I pretty much lost my voice and was sweating from jumping the whole time. It was more than I imagined and they delivered one of the most energetic sets I have ever seen at a show. They then played one of their new songs which I wasn't expecting and I was a bit emotional about it. It hit home that I got to see Slipknot for the first time ever and I'd never forget how much they gave back to us fans.","label":1}

The fact that he overcame his obstacles, was taking medication regularly and met and was marrying a wonderful woman was cause of celebration for all of us. I felt so honored to be there and to be the one who put his boutineer on. My daughter was also one of the flower girls even though she was fourteen at the time. She and the bride's niece were together wearing matching blue maxi dresses and headpieces of baby's breath that made them look like angels. My daughter was suffering from OSFED (otherwise specified eating disorder) at the time and was struggling that day. It was still a wonderful day. Both my brother and his bride are devout Catholics and had a full mass. I haven't been at a mass for a long time because I left the Catholic Church when I was 18. However, the mass was beautiful. Despite it's length, it was still wonderful. Afterward, a friend of my brother's lent him the use of his large house for the reception.

What it looks like, what's going to happen after I'm gone. I never really thought much about it before, never really thought about the past either for that matter. And now, all of a sudden, it's like time has just opened up before me. I think about the baby inside me. Who are they going to be? Where are they going to end up? How will they change the world.

{"text":"Defcon is always a really fun event to attend for a hacker. For me, I always went as a guest. I never knew much about hacking, and even though my best friend was a self proclaimed hacker, nothing he ever tried to show me really clicked.

I always had fun just being there with him and supporting his cause. He was not one of those unethical hackers. I know that the two words kind of go hand in hand, but for him it was never about stealing money from people or invading anyone's privacy. For him, he wanted to take a stand against the government. I don't necessarily agree with that, but I support the guy. So anyway, we get there, and like every year there's tons of hackers, who all get together and try to share knowledge. There's game hackers, computer hackers, you name it, and it had a hacker. Some of the hackers there were the unethical kind. Hackers that just wanted to cause mayhem or steal from others.

{"text":"Three months ago I was in a wreck.  Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, but I was very frightened and upset.  Actually, I was in shock.  This was the first time I had ever been in an accident and I really hope it's the last time.  A man freaked out because he was surrounded by a motorcycle on each side of him and that caused the accident. My perspectiveAuto accidents can be very distressing.  When I was in my teens, my car was hit by a drunk driver while I was driving to a friend's house.  I was alone in the car.  It happened so quickly and so unexpectedly, I didn't have time to react or try to avoid being hit. He knocked my vehicle off the road and into a wooded area.  The windshield shattered, and several pieces of glass fell onto my lap.  I remember feeling stunned when it was over.  My hands were trembling and I couldn't open my car door - it had been pushed in too hard.  Several cars that witnessed the accident stopped to check on me, for which I was very grateful. The police arrived on the scene quickly.  They had to pry the driver side door off my car to get me out.  I still can't believe I wasn't seriously injured.  The police were rather aggressive with the other drive as it became very apparent that he was drunk.  They arrested him and took him away and then another officer very kindly drove me home, since my car was un-driveable. Writing the short summary about someone else's accident brought this memory rather vividly back to life for me.  Not the most pleasant experience of my life, but again, I was thankful neither I, nor the other driver, was seriously hurt.","label":0}

That being said, things came to a boil in May of 2019. I had finally graduated the college I had been slogging over for the past four years. Trials and tribulations were a common occurrence. It was hard to have a social, personal, or just a fun life. My nose was always in some kind of book, and not even a lot of interesting ones. Finally, in May I had seen the things that I wanted to come to fruition happen. It was hard to be praised but I let it happen. As my name was called to walk down the aisle, I heard shouting from certainly my family, who had shown up for me. It was a moment that the loans that I pay now can't put a price on. It's a memorable day. I still get chills thinking about it.","label":0}
{"text":"Well this year has turned to be real shit. After spending the past 4 months with my mother since my Proximal Afib diagnosis making me unable to work. I woke up one day to find out that my mother suddenly collapsed at work and died. My grandmother came to our house and told me that she died. I remember immediately going historical and walking into my bedroom to punch my pillows with all my might screaming no no no no. After a few moments in intense sadness i started to ask questions i was told we had to go to her work to pick up her belongings. So we went to her work and i picked up her purse and her lunch bag. I was crying the whole time and could barely compose my self. Everyone was very understanding and they told me that my mother was a good friend of theirs and they will really miss her. After that i went home and i didn't know what to do i didn't sleep for 3 days and the stress made my proximal afib start up and i my heart raced for hours and i kept having constant PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) about every 10 minutes. because of this i had to go to the ER. I was admitted for 2 days while they watched my hear rate and gave me some types of medications. They made me take a nuclear stress test to see if my heart was damaged, luckily it was not. and i was released later that evening with a prescript for a FDA black label drug called Tambocor to control my hear rate. Its been a few months since then and my grandmother let me live in my mothers house for the time being but that has not lasted very long because my Great aunt died 2 months after my mother from lung cancer. This broke my grandmother. My grandfather died 2 years prior then my mother then her sister. She started having intense crying spells and acting very irrational. So me and my Disabled brother who is on SSI went to stay with her to keep her company. While we were staying with her She constantly verbally abused us. One day she broke down and had to go to the ER for Angina. She told them t hat she wanted to kill her self and was put in the psych ward. My moms sister came down to save her and took her to lie with her. Yesterday i was told that my grandmother was no longer able to think rationally and that my mothers house and grandmothers house was to be sold. I was given until the end of October to get my medical affairs in order and leave the house im currently in.","label":1}
{"text":"I love my daughter very much even though she was a troubled child I've always done what I could to be supportive when my precious girl seemed to be suffering from her imagined foes throughout the first six years of her life . I've even sought outside help from friends, family and professionals to help her. My daughter's father believed that she would stop \"acting out\" if I would stop reacting. I could stop so we were divorced by the time she turned seven and my husband ended up with custody of our daughter. We all co-existed as peacefully for the next 2 years, I was granted every other weekend visitation rights. Not liking the anti-psychotic medications that he found doctors to prescribe for her I had to admit that her visits with the psychologist did seem to bring a sense of calmness to my child and was hopeful my daughter could at some point go on to lead a normal life until 3 days after her ninth birthday. that morning I showered, I dressed and made some breakfast and started going through what I had planned because it was my weekend with my daughter only to have all my plans come crashing to a halt when my phone rang. It was the police and they told me that my daughter there at the station and asked me to come in immediately. I rushed to the police station to find my daughter sobbing uncontrollably in a room with two officers. After entering the room and embracing my child I took a few moment to explain who I was to the officers and wanted to know what happened. Visibly shaken but otherwise unharmed my daughter seemed to be calming now that I was there but she was in no condition to tell me what happened, so I asked the officers. They hadn't gotten very much from her but stated she had not been picked up from school so she walked home yesterday afternoon to discover she had been locked out. They told me that she somehow thought she was responsible and ashamed of this so decided to try and run away, and that she was spotted at the local mall by a security guard that thought it was strange she was there so long unattended. I her \"why didn't you just call me!?!\" She told me the medications her daddy made her take made her mind fuzzy and her time with me was the only thing that made it all better and she didn't want me to think she wasn't getting better because she didn't want to take the chance of having her visits with me become like living with her Daddy. An investigation was held and it turned out \"Daddy\" had my baby on those meds because he had become addicted to them and wanted to use our daughter to get access to more and the locks had been changed by a landlord that was frustrated by late rent payments and \"Daddy\" was so side tracked that he lost track of time looking for drugs. My daughter's happy now and lives with me and is still seeing a psychologist but no longer taking any of those meds.","label":0}

From that time on I promised myself never to give a huge part of my time to a company that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t give a shit about anyone, only themselves, to make lots of money. While sitting at home I decided to start a company so I would be able to do work I love, and to be in total control of what went right and wrong. In the beginning the company didn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t earn much money, so I found a part-time job working 3 days a week, which gave me the opportunity to earn enough money to pay the bills and still have 4 days to work for my own business. But it didn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t work that way. The evenings I was home from the part-time job I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t very productive, which meant that I had to fit all the other stuff (like working on building my company) into the other 4 days, while in the weekends I had lots of assignments. So the actual time I had left to build up my company was reduced to one day a week. In other words: I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t combine it anymore. For me it was clear my company is that one thing I love to do most, so if I want to make it work then I need 150% focus and time. Decision made. I was stupid to trust in her word and not make sure everything was ok.","label":0}
{"text":"I few months ago I moved across the country. My girlfriend came with me as well. We moved from Pennsylvania to Colorado. We packed everything we could fit in our cars and drove across the country. It took us about two and a half days. The drive itself was pretty brutal but it was exciting as well. It was exciting because we had both started a new part of our lives. The most memorable part was when we were driving a long way through Nebraska and there was not anything on either side for miles. Eventually we got to Colorado and it was a great feeling. It felt great because we had finally made it. We both felt very happy. We also felt relieved. I think we also could not believe that we actually decided to move across the country and then actually did it. Looking back we also had fun. I'm glad we made that decision.","label":1}

{"text":"On Mother's Day this year I was given the greatest gift of my entire life. My step-daughter Julie and her husband took me and my husband out for lunch at a fancy little restaurant in town. I was excited to try this place out because I had never gone there before. I was so happy to be able to spend the day with my step-daughter, I hadn't seen her in a while. When we got to the restaurant we sat down and ordered drinks and appetizers. I noticed Julie and her husband kept glancing at each other during the meal, I just thought they were being silly. After the food got to the table then both put their forks down and said they had something to tell us. I was nervous because I thought something bad had happened. Julie had cancer several years ago and I always worry that it will come back. Imagine my surprise, and relief, when they told me they were expecting a baby! My first grandchild! I nearly fell out of my chair. I have always wanted a grandchild. Julie was told many years ago that she would most likely struggle with fertility as a result of her cancer treatment, so we never really expected her to be able to have a baby. This was the greatest news that anyone could have ever given me. My husband and I smiled for a week it felt like afterwards.","label":0}
{"text":"What happened to me yesterday was totally unexpected. I have been so down and out since my 'gray' divorce last year.  I began my cross-country journey a few months ago, living out of a camper van, driving across what seems to be an endless stretch of desert. Life alone is not easy, especially for a divorcee starting over in her 'golden years'.  I normally pull over and eat a quick sandwich in the car, but yesterday, I was just too tired to deal with eat, and really craved the presence of other people for a change. I was happy to see a small but run-down diner on the horizon around lunchtime. When I walked into the smoke-filled diner, a young waitress with a pulled-back pony tail greeted me with a jagged-tooth smile and handed me a menu as she walked me to my booth. I noticed a scant number of other diners seated randomly in the restaurant. As I sat and studied the greasy menu, i happened to peer over the top, feeling the gaze of someone on me. I saw a man sitting at the counter, staring straight at me. He was 50-something, with a tousle of salt-and-pepper hair peeking out from the brim of his cowboy hat. He was dressed simply in blue jeans and a starched shirt, wearing a belt with a large silver buckle. He did not break his gaze on me, as he sipped slowly on a cup of coffee. I have never felt such an instant spark of connection. Suddenly, as our eyes met, I knew it. This man was to be my husband.","label":0}

{"text":"I'm an aunt!!  For the first time, I am an Aunt. My brother, and his wife, had a beautiful baby girl. After years of trying, and a long risky pregnancy, she was finally born on June 22.  She was a high risk pregnancy and they had some complications, so that was kind of scary.   But after days of labor, and sitting around in the waiting room, she was finally born. She was actually born early so she was considered a premature baby.  She had to be hooked up to machines and tested, so there was a lot of anxiety for the first couple of day afterwards. But everything turned out fine and I couldn't be happier!  I've been wishing for this for a while now since I will probably never have kids of my own. So this way I can live vicariously through them. I got to meet her a couple of days after she was born and it was super exciting. I couldn't believe how tiny she was.  She was so small, I was afraid to hold her. Even weeks after she was born I still wouldn't hold her because of how fragile she was.   I know I will be baby sitting a lot in the coming years and seriously am so excited to be able to watch this tiny human grow and learn!","label":1}

Two years later i realized that my wife had an affair and i filed for  Divorce which she accepted.  We parted ways. I moved on. Bitterly couldn't get myself into another relationship.  All this while and i had not seen nor heard from her sister. My company pays well and kept me busy all round the year. I wanted to feel and stay busy  so i didn't fill any vacation. Some of my off days i would be at work. Sometimes even standing in for a colleague just to stay away from idleness and being free. I had no plans of any relationship in the near future.  I finally filled my Leave request form which was accompanied by a heavy bonus and i chose to get out of town for the six weeks. Japn was the place i had dreamt and longed to visit. This was where i bumped into my former Sister In Law.       It was my first experience at a naked Japanese hot spring, which I shared with my sister in law.

{"text":"Three weeks ago, I had a strong chest pain. I did not want to go to the hospital, but my wife made me go. We got there and my chest pain was getting stronger. There was a huge line to be attended and the nurses did not gave me any priority, although I said my chest was in real pain. We waited and waited, until I talked to a nurse, who said everything was fine and that I should just rest. After coming home, my chest pain was slowly decreasing and I thought I was going to be fine. The next day I was feeling good with no chest pain at all. However, I still did not knew what had happen to me the day before. I then scheduled a doctor appointment, that was only available three weeks later. During the three week wait, I was complete fine. The doctor appointment day arrived, and I went to the doctor. He ran some tests and told me that the chest pain I just had three weeks ago was actually an heart attack. To know that scared me a lot, as I did went to the hospital but they did nothing to me. I could have died! Thankfully my heart resisted the heart attack and I am fine. I told my wife what the doctor had told me, and she was very mad with the hospital for not doing anything. Next time something similar to this happens, I will MAKE the hospital take me as a priority, and run exams. I will make that happen even if I have to scream that I am dying from a heart attack.","label":0}

I cried in private and in public. I moaned their deaths feeling suicidal. I arrived to my Uncle's memorial service grief stricken. The next stop was to my best friend's wake.

It was a very hard decision for her to make, and for her family to accept. After she decided this, she came into the office and we talked about what we could do for her.

{"text":"My wife has been trying to convince me to start streaming on Twitch and I finally took the plunge a few months ago. Just this week out of nowhere I got a ton of new follows and went from being a small nobody stream to a not too small not quite a nobody stream with a couple hundred follows and an eighty viewer average. It was at this moment that I realized that maybe I actually could make streaming into something. Apparently people like to watch me once they discover me and find my brand of humor amusing. My wife is currently my only moderator but this also means she's watching my streams when I'm playing and we've grown closer because of the sheer amount of stupid twitch chat\/streaming involves. Last weekend I got a dono from someone that touched me. In it they talked about how they'd been going through a rough time of their lives because their parents had gotten in a car wreck while they were on vacation. They had both lived but their father had gotten paralyzed. He'd been depressed since the accident since he'd always been an active man but now couldn't do that anymore. His father asked him what he was watching and he showed him the stream and they wound up watching me for the entire three hours I was streaming that night. His father's mood apparently improved and he even asked when the next time I'd be streaming is and asked his son if they could watch me together again. I'd never thought that doing something as silly as playing video-games and just shooting the shit with random people in my chat could help. I'm glad to find out I was mistaken though and even if it's just a guy and his father I'm happy to say it at least helped two people. My wife however is living the \"I told you so\" dream at this point and keeps rubbing in that I should have started sooner.

My son`s dad was Jewish, from Poland, but born in New York in 1966. He died of a brain tumor. My son, looks fine, but the kids were born with a brain`s cyst. Both had had a brain surgery to help them, but the cysts (both), are still there. These cysts are affecting their lives, they have to be going to see the Doctor and be checking them. Just a week ago, my little grandson had a surgery again, I went to visit him to the Hospital, and he was looking so delicate, so blue, very, very pale. I am so worried about them, but other than that, when the cysts are not acting, they are healthy, normal, very, very intelligent, I would say that they are geniouses. Really, really smart. And happy. I just love them. They don`t live with me, but they come visit. I love to play with my grandson, he is the one that plays with me. Last night, we were playing, and I showed to him a chess box. We placed all the pieces in the board and we had fun with them. I am so happy he is doing well. He has to wear a helmet because his skull is so thin that one fall could be fatal.

The first time we met was at a park and I thought that would be a good place to ask her to marry me but I thought twice about it.  I then thought of the first date we had which was hiking at a local trail near our home.  Since we both love to hike I decided to propose to her while we were hiking but instead of doing it at our local trail I decided to go for a hike in Griffith Park.  In Griffith Park they have a great hiking trail on Mount Lee which leads you to the top of the Hollywood sign.  We got there really early in the morning and made our ascent up the mountain.  I didn't realize how long it was going to take.  After climbing for three hours we finally made it to the top completely exhausted.  Once we were there I got on my knees and asked her to marry me.  I could see the joy in her face as she said yes.  It was a great feeling something that I will never forget.  Knowing that I picked the right woman made it more special.  We both cried tears of joy and enjoyed the rest of the day celebrating our engagement!","label":1}
{"text":"Today, in Boulder Colorado, we made the long drive to the Rocky Mountain National Park. It was truly an awe inspiring trip. We drove through twisting roads, climbing ever higher, until we finally reached a height of over 11,000 feet. During the trip we were able to pull over at a number of spots to take photos of the breathtaking scenery. In Boulder, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, it was nearly 95 degrees, but at elevation the temperature was in the low 40s, which was quite shocking when climbing out of our SUV to take photos. Just before we arrived at the highest gift shop\/restaurant it began to rain quite hard, then changed to sleet as we ran for cover. It was quite different from the 95 degree heat we had left only an hour and a half earlier. Looking around at the snow capped mountains, some snow only a few dozen feet from where we were standing, demonstrated the ecological diversity that one can experience without having to leave the United States. It was truly amazing eating lunch with my family and looking out at the snow on the Rocky Mountains. We were able to get our fill of souvenirs which we stock up on every vacation so we can easily remember the places we've been and the things we did. Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting. Our family had never been rafting before, let alone in rapids. We had a spectacular time. While the air temperature at river level was still in the 90s, the cold water felt refreshing with every rapid. Being at one with nature and being able to spend an entire day experiencing some of the best that nature has to offer made me incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to enjoy it with my family.","label":1}

I snooped through his messages again, which was totally my  fault and I know that was wrong, but I knew something was up and I was paranoid from all the times he cheated on me. Anyways, turns out he's talking to Liz again so I wasn't completely crazy. According to his messages he loves her, he's loved her this whole time he's been with me, which feels super not great. The sad thing is that he wouldn't even admit it to me, I tried to get him to confess the truth on his own a few times, and he always just denied it. What a pathetic liar. Of course I finally told him I knew the truth and then that was a whole thing. But it's okay. Whatever. I'm so done putting time into that boy when he couldn't even be bothered to get his act long enough to hold down a job. I know I deserve better. There is no excuse to cheating and he is just a cowardly child who is too afraid of being alone and having to grow up to ever be a person worth anything. He wanted us to be friends still.

I am having a difficult time writing this because I felt as if Dad and I were starting to get close again after such a long time apart.  Until Dad's cancer, I hadn't seen or talked to him in over 10 years.  The bitterness that I held inside was very taxing on me and I'm sure on him as well.  When he left Mom for another woman, he destroyed our lives.  As a little girl, I always looked to Dad as my hero.  I truly looked up to him and thought of him as the greatest man on earth.  I always felt that if I ever got married, I wanted my husband to have the same characteristics as Dad.  After Dad left, I began a downward spiral and didn't want anything to do with any man.  Through prayer and guidance, I have been able to get past these feelings and realize that I can't put every man in the same category.  After Dad was diagnosed with Cancer, he asked to see me and we talked many times and began to heal our relationship.  Dad regretted the horrible mistakes he made and asked forgiveness from God, Mom and me.    Just saying \"I forgive you\" began the healing process for both of us.  Sadly, it wasn't long after that the Lord decided to take Dad.  I believe that knowing he was forgiven allowed him to die peacefully and with the love of God and family.","label":0}

I have been involved with the church choir music for many years but knowing my peers though highly enough of me to choose me to lead it was really humbling.  I really worked so hard at preparing the music selections.  I tried to think of the events of the month and things that were going to be spoken about in the service.  I wanted songs everyone could relate to as well.  These were known songs and everyone there really seemed to enjoy it.  I met with the pastor as well as the other church members and reviewed the selections with him which he had no problem approving.  This suprised me as I thought I would have to tweak a few of them.

We caught pokemon that was different then eachothers and we battled them as we caught new ones. We just simply linked our gameboys and played agianst eachother. People at the party were watching us and even rooting for me and my cousin as we had intense matches that day. All lower level pokemons. Me and my cousins are some big time fans of pokemon. The people at the party thought we were ridiculous for playing games like this but this makes us happy!","label":1}
{"text":"The other week I met up with some friends to go to the beach. While we were at the beach we noticed that some people were having some type of problem. It turned out to be an older couple. I helped them and administered CPR. The old guy was ok after that. The couple thanked me and asked me for my phone number. I gave it to them, and they told me that they would be in touch. Later in the week we saw the old people again, they thanked me and told me to stop by later at their house. When I arrived, they lived in a fabulous mansion. They said that they were worth millions and offered me a job. I\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4m still deciding if I should take the job or not. It is a tough decision, and I\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4m still struggling to make it. It is very tough for me to decide. I decided to talk to my parents about the opportunity, as it would be a life changing event. And in addition, it would require me to move to a new area and start over. This week, the people that I saved reached out to me and offered the job again.","label":0}

I saw my friend trip and fall into a bus that was oncoming in traffic. it was arguably the worst thing i've ever seen or witnessed in my entire life. it was just terrible and i hate to think about it. The bus immediately stopped as well, but she was dead on impact. The bus was going very fast as well, it wasn't slowing down. My friend should still be alive. She accidentally tripped and fell.

{"text":"Around a month ago, I submitted a batch of applications for freelance work. It was in the middle of the evening, and I was in the middle of a cold, so I hoped to spend the rest of the day recovering. However, I received a message on the job website--a response to my application, and a request to interview right away. I was taken aback, not expecting something so soon and so relatively informal. The interview was to be done on Google Hangouts, as soon as possible. This sounded strange, but the position was fairly small and low-skilled, but certainly better than nothing. I made coffee and psyched myself up. As I came back to the site, I received more messages from the person--impatient and passive-aggressive in tone, admonishing me for taken long to reply. I apologized, and did my best to get in touch with their people and set-up the interview. I received some interruptions from my grandfather, who was going through a tough time, and I helped him as best I could, as quickly as I could, and apologized to the person. They continued to push me along in a brusque manner, but I was grateful for the opportunity. I began the interview, and for the most part, things went off without a hitch. While I could've used more occupational experience in some of the job's aspects, I was otherwise qualified. However, I noticed that the person's grammar was somewhat odd. As they claimed to be from France, it was not something that I could judge. That being said, once they seemed clueless about my specific posting, and offered more than twice the amount that I had put in for, I became extremely skeptical. As they waited for me to answer a variety of questions, I took the time to search the name of the company and my general predicament. I was met with several warnings to immediately shut down the interview and walk away: my interviewer an apparent scammer. My heart sank, and I quickly poured over every bit of information I'd shared. It was nothing more than my business e-mail and phone, but still things that I do not want bothered. I blocked the interviewer, as well as the people that had directed me to them, and kept an eye out on strange contacts from phone or e-mail. I've been lucky not to have received too much harassment, but I still feel uneasy. This has been a learning experience, and has given me a healthy skepticism in things that may seem too good to be true.","label":1}

He smiles and laughs all the time, especially when he sees me. There's nothing else on Earth quite like being a father.  And then the moment my wife and I have been waiting for finally happened. 4 months ago, he took his first steps. I was sitting on the floor, about 10 feet away from my wife. She was holding him by his hands, and he climbed up to his feet as she helped him. Her smile was so big, and he giggled at her reaction. My heart began to pound. Was he finally going to do it? Was this the day? She pointed at me and said, \"Go to daddy!\" He looked over at me, then back at her. She smiled and pointed to me again. \"Go to daddy!\" He turned back to me, reached one hand towards me, and I opened my arms wide. At that moment, he picked up one foot and stepped out towards me. My heart jumped with joy. She let go of his other hand and he wobbled ever so slightly, then picked up his other foot and stepped again in my directions. A tear welled up in my eye and I opened my arms again. \"Come on, buddy! Come to daddy!\" He smiled wide and picked up his foot again, placing it towards me once more. But here he faltered, wobbled, and fell to his butt. He giggled, I laughed with joy and my wife gathered him up for a hug. It was the first best day of my life.","label":0}
{"text":"About six months ago, my ex broke into my friend's garage, because he had been looking for me all night and couldn't find where I was.  At the time, we had lived apart for over 3 years, but he remained obsessed with me. I was with my boyfriend that night, and in the morning stopped at my friend's house before going home.  My friend's garage was opened about 2 feet, and I was sitting in the garage waiting for her to get back from picking our friend up at the Amtrak station.  I was looking down at my phone when suddenly my ex was on the ground, on his stomach, sliding under the garage door.  He grabbed me and asked where i had been all night, and started pleading and begging me to tell him.  I didn't tell him where I was or who  I was with because it was nine of his business.  He then switched gears completely, and suddenly got very angry.  He was still holding me by my upper arms, when he slammed me down on the ground on top of something piled up in the garage.  Whatever it was he slammed me down on, had a peg sticking out of it, and it felt like it went straight through me, straight through my organs.  My first thought was a couple more blows like that and I would be dead.  As I got up I realized I suddenly couldn't breathe very well, and I said \"You really hurt me.\"  He didn't seem to hear me though, and so I sat down on the chair to catch my breath.  He was still angry and he hit me in the face, afterwards saying, \"please dont call the police.\"  I told him I wouldn't call the police if he would just please leave, then he saw me holding my cell phone and a struggle followed.  He started trying to grab my phone from my hands and I resisted.  We struggled for some time with it until it dropped on the floor and i kicked it under the motorcycle.  My attempts to keep him from my phone failed tho, and he reached across and grabbed my phone.  I told him I couldn't breathe and he told me I was breathing just fine. He took my phone and took off.  It was the reason why he came in the first place.  He was dying to know, where I had been that night and who I was with.Luckily, my friends came back moments later and drove me to the emergency room.  I suffered 2 broken ribs and a collapsed lung from the incident, not to mention my Iphone that he stole.Now, my ex has a pending court case.

About 6 months ago, my car broke down and I had to bring it to the shop. It was going to cost $7,000 to fix, so I had to save up the money to fix it. This made it so that I could not get to church without taking the bus since it is so far. It was terrible taking the bus. It was smelly and it took two hours to get to church. So I asked around for someone to give me a ride and the only one who offered was Mike. I don't really like Mike. He is a Republican and is very  vocal about his beliefs. I don't like hearing about them since I don't agree with his views. I feel like he just wants to take me for a ride because he wants to persuade me to follow his political ideals. But, at the same time, it really helps me out and saves time to get a ride with him. Maybe I am overreacting and should just ignore his opinions since it saves me time. I don't really know what to do. I cant wait until I can afford to fix my car! I am really close to saving the money.","label":0}

The umbilical cord was around her neck, but it didn't tighten until she was coming through the birth canal. There had been no distress in the womb, and the heartbeat had been regular. We had to call an ambulance, which showed up within 10 minutes. They immediately put an oxygen mask on my daughter to help her breathe. My husband accompanied my daughter in the ambulance to the hospital. My doula had to help me deliver the placenta and help me get cleaned up, dressed, and headed to the hospital. When I got to the hospital, I was put in a wheelchair because I still felt very weak, and I was pushed up to the NICU where my daughter and husband were. They had stabilized her and had her on oxygen, and her oxygen level was 82%. My daughter also had pneumonia and was in the hospital for 1 week on antibiotics before being released to go home as a very healthy 9-lb-13-oz baby.

It was an  event up near where she lives which is approximately 60 miles from where i live and where she grew up.   We all set up on the grass to watch one of my favorite bands, The Beach Boys. it was myself, my daughter, her husband and her three kids.   I have never seen them in person and they were amazing of course.  After about an hour i had to use the ladies room.  Upon returning, i saw my daughter talking to a guy who i just thought was striking up conversation about the concert.  Imagine my surprise, when i walked over and he introduced himself as Richard who i grew up with in my old neighborhood.  .  While i did remember his name, i did not recognize him.  i remember he lived across the street from me and that we went to the same school  When we were really young he had a crush on me but as we got older we had different friends.  He moved away when we were both sixteen.  The strange part comes next in how he began talking to my daughter.  He  said  was walking by my daughter and her family and immediately realized that she looked like someone he had known growing up (me).  He said he felt sort of uncomfortable approaching her but the resemblance was so uncanny he just had to.  He then asked if her mothers name was Debbie  and if she lived on the street where i grew up as a kid.   Of course she said yes but also added that i was at the concert and just in the ladies room.  We reminisced for a while but the most amazing thing was how much she must look like me to be able to recognize her as my daughter after all these years!  Also i find it amazing for anyone to remember me all those years, especially since i didn't  remember them (by looks).","label":1}
{"text":"My mother have a heart disease, so I planned to move her to an assisted living residence.There is limitations for Assisted living is not a nursing home with nicer furniture. Nursing care is not offered, nor does this kind of facility have legal authority to give skilled nursing care. If a nurse is on staff, the nurse's role is limited to assessment and directing the resident assistants. Some assisted living facilities also have a separate nursing home wing or section, and that requires a different license to be a skilled nursing facility. If there is an emergency, no one will not offer emergency care. It is difficult to care for, or needs frequent treatment for chronic conditions, the assisted living facility may not accept them. A doctor has to verify that they are suitable by signing a form. On top of that, the facility does its own assessment to see if the prospective resident is a fit for their community. No one is watching over your loved one 24\/7. Help is available, but your aging parent will not have a personal attendant noting their every move. Someone will check on them daily and if they don't show up for meals, someone will notice. If medications are being given out by the attendant (\"med tech\") every day or more than once a day, that person will notice if something is wrong. They help with basics but should not be expected to diagnose, or offer anything other than exactly the medications on the resident's list. They may ask the nurse to check on a resident. These homes offer an enriched social environment. There are meals in common and a chance to socialize, activities offered, and entertainment of various kinds. Some communities offer classes. Residents have a way to call someone if there is a problem. If they're not feeling well, an assistant can be summoned by either pulling a cord, a call bell, or pressing a button. The proximity of attention to an aging parent's needs is one of the best ways to assuage the worries of adult children. The actual cost of assisted living may not be fully understood when you size up a place under consideration. You may be quoted the price for the rent of the apartment. The cost is usually more than the rent, as your loved one must also pay many other charges. If help is needed with bathing, for example, there is an additional cost for that.Mom can't remember to take her pills? \"Medication management\" can be a huge cost on top of the basic rent.","label":0}

{"text":"This past June was a momentous time in my life for a couple of reasons.  Towards the beginning of the month I turned 26 years old and a week or so after that I graduated from UC San Diego with an engineering degree.  It marked the beginning of my true independence and adulthood, though I may have been considered an adult before.  Upon graduating I began to realize the responsibility and pressures that life was staring to lay upon me.   Before I graduated life was very simple and my only responsibilities were to complete my education and enjoy my time in sunny San Diego.  After graduating I was tasked with finding a career that I truly enjoyed and that would also provide me with the opportunity to live comfortably for the rest of my life.  The stresses of this event were compounded by the fact that I lost my father to cancer a few months prior to graduation.  This would mean that I have to contribute to my family financially and emotionally during a time that was meant to be unique and special.  I went from enjoying the college life to stressing about the future. The loss of my father had a profound impact on my studies and my view of the world. My mother and sister flew in from far away to watch me graduate. We spent the week together sightseeing and visiting places that we would enjoy.  We also visited places that my father would have enjoyed seeing such as Naval museums and where he used to live.  It was an emotional graduation ceremony because we all knew how hard I had worked over the past six years and that my father was not there to see it through.  There were many ups and downs, including transferring from a community college to a good university, family health issues, as well as money issues.  All of these issues and triumphant events made the graduation ceremony much more meaningful to us all.  I still do not know where my life is headed, however this was a major stepping stone in my life's story and I am proud of my accomplishments.  As I look forward I hope to find a meaningful career that I can utilize the skills I have developed over the past several years.","label":1}

I was worried but I assumed he'd be ok, because it's not like that's uncommon, and if he's at the hospital he'd be fine. But then my dad called the next day and told me they found spots in his lungs. Then they said it was cancer. Apparently it started in his kidney and had already spread all over his body. It was also in his brain and some other places. Then I was really terrified.

She had charisma and truly brought my family together. Although death comes with life, we did not expect her life to end so abruptly. We noticed her struggling the breathe, but we didn't think much of it. Quite possible she may have had a cold or maybe she was struggling with allergies. It turned out that it was much more. Lilly suffered from a tumor on her heart and mucous that surrounded her lungs. We knew the results were unfavorable, but we didn't quite understand the severity. It was almost impossible to wrap our heads around. This seemingly healthy, happy, and beautiful dog was ill and right before our eyes we couldn't even grasp it. Within a week it was determined that to allow her the tiniest amount of suffering possible we would have to put her to sleep. It crushed us. It crushed me.

{"text":"Dear Diary. My Wife and I just arrived in Portland, Oregon. It is our first time to the city. The airport was older, but still OK, we did not spend much time there. We took a lyft to our hotel, and the driver informed us about a protest that was scheduled for that day. We were unaware of that protest. The driver told us that the proud boys, anti-fa, and the pride rally were all meeting to protest one another. The protests started peaceful, until the protesters began to interact. At the time, the proud boy group was mostly tame, which is out of character for the group. Surprisingly, anti-fa began attacking the pride rally. I was not expecting this, i thought both groups were aligned on the same side of the political spectrum. Anti-fa attacked pride members with \"concrete milkshakes\" which were milkshakes make with quick dry concrete. This attack happened a block from our hotel. A few hours into the \"protest\" homeland security dressed in full tactical gear were dispatched and took control of the square where the protests were happening. This was a shock to my wife and I. We were not expecting this when we arrived to Portland! Turns out, this is fairly common in Portland. The hotel only told us to avoid the protests, and they did not seem surprised by the officers in tactical gear. One of the most odd experiences we had was the next morning. We ate breakfast at a food truck that was parked in the square where the protests happened. We ate breakfast in a peaceful square on a beautiful morning, like nothing had happened just a few hours before. It was truly an interesting start to our trip and something i will not soon forget.","label":1}

Most of the morning I was in pain and finnaly ended up calling the doctor about it. They told me I should call my dentist as there was nothing they could do. So I call them and they told me that I had to wait until the next day in order to even see them. I tried taking pain meds and orajel and it did help a little bit but not as much as I hoped. So the next morning came around and I finnaly went there and the told me I needed a root canal! I was pretty nervous that it would hurt quite a bit but I knew in the long run it would be better for my teeth. So after about a 15 minute procedure it was all over. They were nice for the most part but boy did it hurt quite a bit. I would say after about 15 minutes it started to hurt worse but they did give me much better pain pills to deal with it. Later that night I was starting to feel a bit better. When I work up in the morning I was pain free and it was great. Overall I am glad I went and got it done quickly.","label":0}

{"text":"The in the middle of February of 2019, I had to attend my grandfather's funeral. This required me from leaving my current state that I was living in to travel to the state he lived in. It was a 2 day exhausting car ride and by the time I had reached the funeral home, I was tired but still felt emotionally taxed as I saw my grandfather in his casket. What I did not expect to happen for me was that I was overwhelmed with emotions of seeing my grandfather who had now passed away. I was unsure how to take the feeling and felt conflicted with myself as I had rarely talked with him. In all my life, I had only talked with him a dozen times, and mostly these conversations were insignificant. And yet here, I was on the verge of tears. After the funeral was completed and my grandfather was buried, I didn't feel those emotions again. I was unsure whether this was me or how I viewed my grandfather. As the week progressed on, I knew I was all right and that I saw death as a natural process to life. The following week after required me to return home to my home state. The drive home was ever more tiresome as it required me to drive for hours on end, sleep at a hotel and wake up to keep going. By the time I arrived home, I was completely wiped out. I did not want to talk to anyone and I did not want to eat much. This took another week before I was fully myself again.","label":1}

{"text":"This summer my son joined a teenagers baseball league with his afterschool activities comity.  He has not played baseball for atleast 5 years, and seeing him start again is so awesome! He used to be so amazing, but eventually he lost interest. I am not a baseball kind of guy, but i am a total baseball dad. I loved going to see his games, james always out performed expectations. Once he began to lose interest, it went downhill very quick. Now that he has begun again, he is back to being incredible, and outperforming my, and everybody else's expectations.  I honestly think he could make a career out of it, if that is what he wants. He can pitch better then anyone, he can bat and has the home run record at his school. He has all the attributes it would take to go professional. He would make a great role model. Even his coach said he is amazed. My son was able to get right back into the swing of things. This summer will be another amazing summer. I get to spend my free time, watching my son crush baseballs, and there is nothing i would rather spend my time doing. Warm summers, cold drinks, and watching their son excel at competition, is what i think almost every father on planet earth can enjoy","label":0}

On the 23rd of May, 2019, My cousin Sarah Jones was celebrating her birthday, which brings us the friends and family together. Sarah ofcourse is the talk of the town due to her generous lifestyle and beauty. She dragged me all the way in getting the party set. I had gotten a nice Gucci footwear as a present for her.   At evening as people get around to start the jamz, i suddenly sited a lady, so elegant and sparkling at the corner of the room. i was dazed at such beauty.

{"text":"Last week i was offered to do some work evaluating certain businesses on different points of views including customer care. I decided i would do it, the problem was that these business were far and places I've never been. I also needed to go in a car, so i had to drive there and come back home on the same day. I decided i would do it, even though i felt a little scared. I woke up early that day because i knew it was going to take me a long time. I remember i felt very excited the moment that the road trip started. I reached the first destination an hour and a half later, it took me a while to finish because i didn't have enough experience, but it went well. then i went to my second destination, the supervisor was suspicious of me because it was Sunday and he wasn't informed of any evaluation, i had to explain everything to him for about 20 minutes, i wasted a lot of time there but finished without any other trouble. After that it was all new to me, I've never been to the next place before, it was all new from that point on and it was very exciting, i saw beautiful beaches, amazing landmarks, nice cities, and warm people. It was like that for the next 2 stops, but after that i got a flat tire. I was nervous because it was 3 PM and i still had 2 more stops on the road ahead. I managed to get it fixed after half an hour and went to my next stop. After that i went to a nearby beach and took a 20-minute break. I stop and admired the view, it was a beautiful sight, took away the stress i had at the moment, but it was time to move. It took me an hour to reach my last destination. When i got there i was tired, and then i witnessed an accident, i stopped the work to help the injured person. After that i got stressed out, but managed to finish. Then i stopped at a convenience store and bought a beer to clear my mind. Then i was on my way home. 4 hours later i was on my bed, thinking about everything i saw, i was proud of what i did, i felt free, i can't wait for the next opportunity to do it again.","label":1}

Luckily this wasn't a tourist beach. His uncle's house was right on the shore. No long lines. I spent the three days up to the fourth on the beach. I burned but it was worth it. I read books. I drank beer. I didn't think about work. Then on the fourth we had our own fireworks show. At the end of the vacation I was sad it was over but my energy was back.","label":1}

{"text":"My son and his wife are severe alcoholics.  Over the years I've loaned them quite a bit of money (which they never repay) when I've been optimistic that they're straightening out their lives and need help to move forward.  This July they lost their jobs as motel managers in Utah and returned here, homeless with two cats and a dog.  They moved into my daughter's garage and went on a ten-day bender.  They neglected their pets, had violent arguments, didn't return their U-Haul which was about to be reported as stolen, etc.  My daughter asked my son's wife to leave after she made a drunken scene insulting her neighbors.  She got a motel room and decided she'd just like to stay there.  My daughter and I handled everything for them and my son eventually snapped out of it.  He asked me if he could borrow $250 which he'd repay when he got a check in the mail in a few days and I foolishly agreed.  The check did come and he called me and said he was coming right over with the money and asked if he could do some laundry.  I haven't seen him since.  He took the money and paid for some more nights in the motel room and lots of vodka.  I was taking care of his dog who howled all day and night with separation anxiety.  I've been worried and scared for my son's health and safety for a long time but after this incident, that's changed into anger and fear for my own safety from people who absolutely put alcohol ahead of everything in life.  It was a new low since before lying and stealing hadn't been part of the picture.","label":1}
{"text":"I recently had a few different drastically life changing events take place. One of which is the beginning of a divorce. After ten years of marriage, my husband decided he wanted a divorce. After some of the awful things he did in our marriage, I was still hanging in hoping we could move past all the hurt and betrayal. But unfortunately, he got fed up with the process and decided to end it. Just within the last three months I have agreed to give him the divorce, had him lash out at me in unspeakable ways, been forced to move due to lack of ability to continue paying for the previous place and had to pick up the pieces for myself and my three young children. I thank God that he has given me several people in my life that have been there for me and helped me through all of this. Without them, it would have been way worse. I am still trying to get through this divorce, but I have faith that the Lord will work all this for good. Many other changes have come along with this divorce. Of course the move. The change in family dynamic, which has been the worst and most difficult change. The financial changes. The emotional changes in me, which I struggle with every single day. The coping of my children. Yes, this has been quite the emotional roller coaster. I am still looking to the Lord for daily strength.","label":1}

I was very happy for her and proud that she wanted me as her maid of honor.  The wedding was beautiful, she had saved up for quite some time and spared no expense in getting exactly what she wanted.  The venue was beautiful and it definitely reminded me of a fairy tale wedding to say the very least. While we were at the reception having a great time, I was finally able to congratulate her and give her a big hug.  Unfortunately, not used to wearing heels, I tripped just as we were leaning in for a hug and I spilled my red wine all over her beautiful and no doubt very expensive dress.  I was mortified!  Fortunately, she laughed it off and told me that it only made her dress have more character and something to remember the event by.  I have always been somewhat of a klutz so this isn't out of the ordinary for me in the very least.  I can only hope the stain comes out as I would hate to think I've ruined such a beautiful gown! All in all I am quite embarrassed but very happy for my sister.  This was one event that I was proud to attend, even if it was ruined by a little red wine.

I could not afford a creamation, and that was sad and tragic for me. So, I turned to the Internet. Thankfully, I found the website GoFundMe. That allowed me to solicit donations toassist in my plight. It was uncertain how it would happen, but luckily enough people on the internet found my story.

As I was getting dressed in the back, my mind was racing. I was surrounded by my friends and future colleagues. We can all say that we had finally made it to the finish line. All those long nights and the endless amount of homework was finally coming to an end. Many of had jobs lined up for us and if we didn't we were excellent prospects. As the lady in the front gave the signal, we all lined up and walked into the reception area, we were all greeted by our loved ones. The ones who stood by us and supported us as we made this transition into the \"real world\". We sat silently as they called our names. As the names were called, we one by one, stood and shook the president of the school's hand. We each took a quick photo and moved to accept our diploma. All the cheering and support bought tears to my eyes. It was happy and sad tears. I was sad to see all my friends go in different directions, but I was happy that they were all starting a new chapter in their lives. The graduation was short, but it was a memorable one.","label":1}

They were nice plain black shoes and I got a good deal on them. Lucky for me they were also comfortable, because we stood around for nearly two hours before the ceremony began. The longer it took, the more nervous I got. I wish we could just get it over with. When my diploma was finally in my hands I was so proud of myself I could barely stand still. My family was very supportive, but I had no idea they were going to throw me a party. It was the best party ever since my grandmother and my Aunt Lois were there.

She was an accountant, I was aspiring designer for graphics who was currently struggling to actually find work. We just so happened to be in the same place and ran into each other where a conversation was sparked. The first time we met I realized how beautiful she was. How amazing she was a person even knowing what I did for a job and seeing how sparingly at the time my work was coming in, she still gave me the time of day and respected me and I was very happy about that personally. So I was more than willing to just conversate with her. We sat down and I offered to buy her something to eat and drink and she was more than happy to do that. We talked even more and we couldn't get enough of each other at that point. Looking in her eyes I knew that I didn't want that night to end. I wanted to keep that and I wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing, at times I was nervous but I knew that over-time I would be more comfortable. So we kept talking and talking and you know the old saying that when you're having fun time flies by. Eventually we realized that after eating we literally sat and talked for a whole hour afterwards. I apologized for holding her time but she was telling me right away that she enjoyed her time. We exchanged numbers and a few months later we ended up dating. I was very pleased with how everything turned out and what I'm trying to say is that you never know where love or a friendship is hiding, it could literally be in plain sight.","label":1}

{"text":"I have always thought love at first sight is a not for me until this very day. It was 4 months ago when I rode the Metro as usual after work. I had stayed back to cover an important part of my task before going home. At 8 pm, I was just leaving the office. I was pretty famished and all in my head was what I will get to bite when I reach home. I sat down gently by the window. The seat next to me was empty and I was just praying it wouldn't be a mother with a kid that will come and sit next to me. I like kids but at that point, I didn't just want one to disturb my peaceful ride back home. I brought out my phone and starting checking Reddit for the popular posts on that day. The seat next to me was still empty. I didn't know what made me look far right, beyond an elderly man was this lady on glasses. Her nose came out a little than the other girls I know. Just when I was praying that she looks sideways so I see what she looks like, she turned sideways. I froze at the spot. It took about 10 seconds to caution myself that I've been staring way too much. Those 10 seconds were the most enchanting moment of my life. The elderly man seated next to her left and maybe not wanting to sit alone, she came to sit just beside me.  I can't say maybe it was the scent of her that made my nervous that one word could not leave my already slightly opened lips or that I didn't expect her to make that move. I just slowly turned back to checking Reddit. I still feel bad I didn't even say Hi.","label":0}

{"text":"I have been trying to get out and be more active lately. My doctor initially told me it would be a good idea to help ease my symptoms, but I'm starting to really enjoy being out and about. About three months ago I was especially restless one morning and opted to take myself out for a day of fun. I hit the local mall and walked all through my favorite stores. I probably spent a full hour in Macy's alone. I bought a pair of new sandals and a really cute beach hat too, which are things that coincidentally help reinforce this new lifestyle I'm trying out. After shopping I stopped into a new restaurant that opened near the mall. It felt odd to eat by myself, but after a few minutes I really started to enjoy it. I almost felt like some important business person. My steak was perfectly cooked and I even had a margarita to drink. By this point I really started to feel my legs getting achy, and the 100 degree temperatures outside didn't exactly help things too much. Against my better judgement I ended up deciding to see a movie to cool down, but found myself frustrated when I realized the theater's air conditioning was turned off. Who turns off AC in 100 degree heat?!? I ended up finishing the movie, but my legs were not in great shape and I was feeling quite dehydrated. After sitting on a bench for a bit to gather my thoughts, I determined that I should not try to get home in this shape. Thankfully my good friend Judith answered her phone and was willing to come get me and take me home. I apologized to her for overextending myself on this day, but I think she understood how much I enjoyed my independence. Next time I might have to take it a little easier on these hot days!","label":0}
{"text":"A few months ago, I got married to my husband. However, the events leading up to the ceremony were pretty stressful. To start, the weather was lousy. We were having an outdoor wedding. It looked like it was going to rain, and it was already very windy. We were worried that some of the setup might just blow over from the wind. Also, we hit a lot of traffic going over to the venue, and I was already very stressed. My wedding dress also felt like it was not fitting right, even though it fit perfectly when I tried it on numerous times before. However, this could have been in my head, as I was already very stressed about the wedding and everything that was going on. It's not like I did not love my soon to be husband. Nor did I have second thoughts about it. On the contrary, I love him very much, and I was just looking forward to getting the ceremony started. When I finally walked down the aisle with my father and I saw my husband to be, I felt way better. Seeing him standing up there just seemed to alleviate all the stress. With that being said, the most surprising thing that happened was when the ring bearer tripped and fell. He quickly got up though, and he acted like nothing happened. It ended up not raining, and the wedding was relatively calm after that.","label":0}

{"text":"I never expected this to turn out this way! When we learned that our friend needed a place to stay for a few days, I was happy to volunteer our home.  I mean I had known her for years so she was almost like family to me.  Who knew it would be a disaster!  You never really know someone unless you live with them is very true!  She kept the TV on all night (loudly), she ate what she wanted from the refridgerator and left quite a mess of chips on the couch and floor.  She did not even volunteer to clean it up.  She helped herself to the milk although she knew we did not have extra left for my children.  Furthermore, she was in the bathroom for quite a while showering in the morning, even thought I told her the time my children needed to be in there to get ready for school  Mind you, she had no where to be that day.  She could have showered at a later time but just did not care.  They were late for the bus and I had to drive them in because of her rudeness.  When I approached her about this, she just shrugged it off.  It is like she was a special guest we needed to cater to, rather than just being thankful she had a place to stay for a few days.  If she acts like this at home, no wonder her boyfriend asked her to move out!  I will NEVER let a \"friend stay in my home like this again?","label":0}
{"text":"The day started off like any other day.  I was going about my business around the house and as was his habit, my brother asked me for a ride to the gym.  His car was in the shop getting fixed and of course I agreed.  The gym is a short distance away and I've been in a position where I didn't have access to my own vehicle before, so I know the feeling.  I had just dropped him off and was headed out to take care of some errands.  As I crossed through an intersection, I heard the screech of tires and caught sight of a vehicle skidding through the red light and into my passenger door.  I composed myself quickly and we both pulled over to assess the damage.  To no one's surprise, a young woman whose phone was glued to her hand had caused the accident.  I was not happy about the time and expense this was going to cause me, but the girl was as helpful as she could be.  It was refreshing to hear her agree that she was 100% at fault.  Her father also had premium insurance, so everything would be taken care of.  As I made a previously-unexpected trip to the body shop, I thought about how the day had started helping my own brother out because of his lack of transportation.  Now I would be without my own car for a time.  It's funny how the opportunity to show kindness to someone down on their luck can flip back on you providing someone else the opportunity to show kindness to you.  I hope my brother isn't too tired from his workout to walk home.","label":0}

{"text":"About two days ago I went to a family gathering event on a Sunday morning, and there was a lot of people there. I had been invited about a week prior and I had been very excited to go to the event. The event was a Family Fishing derby being held for family and family friends at one of my aunt's fishing stock ponds near her house. It was a potluck type event, but there was plenty of good food to be had like hotdogs, burgers, and macaroni salad. I ate a lot more than I anticipated and gave myself a bit of a stomachache but I still don't regret it either because I enjoyed it all. Along with the fishing contest there were other activities like frog catching with nets, with prizes for catching the biggest frog or fish. After that was the annual picture with all the kids and young adults who hadn't reached thirty yet, I was in that photo too. Then after we did that we watched the littler kids all participate in the frog race, where on a sheet they would race the captured frogs to win other prizes. I didn't participate in the games because I had already outgrown the age range of the kids participating. It was fun just watching the kids and teens have fun though, and I got to eat more while I watched. I indulged myself in dessert and talking to some of the family members I didn't usually get many chances to see casually. Also I nearly had a frog jump on me during the frog race for the kids. While I like frogs, I don't like slimy feels so I jumped back a bit when the kids were releasing all the caught frogs back into the pond. At the end of the event we all got commemorative coins for the event that my aunt had specially prepared for the occasion and I was happy to get one. Before I left the event to go home, I picked some wild apples from an apple tree near the road entrance on my aunt's property with my mom, who'd attended the event with me. I think I'll remember the family fishing derby that occurred this year very fondly for years to come.","label":1}

{"text":"About four months ago my oldest cat started to act strange. She didn't eat as much as she normally would. She didn't play as much as she used to. She didn't even interact with me or any of the other cats as she normally would. So I figured she was either sick or depressed but cats don't get depressed. I assumed she had some type of sickness going on. She had all of her recent shots and just came from a vet check about a month ago. I still ended up taking her to the vet just to see what may be going on so I wanted to get her checked up on. After waiting for a few hours the veternarian told me that my cat had a caught a disease that was going around in the neighborhood. I was in shock because none of the other cats had gotten sick only this one. The vet told me that my cat could pass away within a few weeks. There wasn't any cures at the time if there had been I would have definitely tried to get one for my cat. A few weeks had passed by and my cat had finally passed away. Myself and all the other cats were extremely sad about the situation. Although it doesn't seem like it may happen I am not worried about my other cats getting sick.","label":0}

I worked on my resume and case for weeks on end to ensure i had the best chance of getting the position. i got into a few spats with coworkers about who should be promoted as well. this caused a lot of tension among us and made actual work tough for nearly a month. we had a first wave of interviews that knocked out half of the applicants. this made things even worse as some longer tenured employees were not pushed through to the second round of interviews. i was lucky enough to be pushed through myself. after the second round, we had two days where we did not know who had won the position. this was also stressful for us and put more tension on the office and all of us personally, as it was a life changing event for anyone who won the spot due to the salary and our life trajectories. after a few days, my manager called me into his office and informed me that i had won the position. this was a surprise to me as i thought other members were favored over me and would get the position. i was ecstatic to win the spot, as my salary more than doubled and i got great benefits. despite the stresses i was very happy with the situation.","label":1}

{"text":"Three months ago, I had given my final exams. Vacations were coming up, and I had nothing much to do. I talked to my mother, who lives away, and I told her that I am coming over for my vacations. She told me that my grandmother has not been feeling very well lately, and I should see her. It sounded like a good idea, and I changed my plan. Instead, I visited my grandmother in the hospital, and decided that I would stay there for a week. Doctors told me that due to her diabetes, she has been feeling very unwell. However, I thought it was because of loneliness, since she also used to live alone. She was very happy to see me, and even happier when she got to know that I am there to stay with her. I brought over some books, which I used to read it to her. She had been showing a tremendous positive progress since I had went to her. After a week, I had to go back to my home to meet my family. I felt really upset on leaving her alone like that. After some days, the doctors told that her health is declining again, and it would be very difficult for her to survive. The news was indeed very saddening, however I was thankful that I got to spend her last days together.","label":0}

We woke up in the morning and exchanged words, kisses, and gifts, as we had officially been dating for 5 years! After we had woken up we made breakfast and sat and talked about what we should do for the day as we had our whole day free. She smirked and acted as if she had something to say but was holding back. After a moment it's as if she burst and with a wide grin she explained how she had a surprise planned and I had an hour to pack. Excited and nervous, I quickly threw clothes and necessities into a bag and before I knew it we were on our way! We drove into the city and on the way we listened to our favorite songs, laughed, and talked about our days' plans. We checked into the pre-booked hotel room and jumped on the bed. After settling in we left and explored the city. Although we've been to the city numerous times, it's always exciting to visit our favorite spots and look for things we'd missed or forgotten about. We ate plenty of great food, saw plenty of cute dogs (our favorite), and had a day full of love. It's always nice getting surprised and I was so taken back by her actually planning all of this without me knowing! She's not usually one to be able to keep a surprise so this was very out of character. Overall we had a great anniversary and the only thing that could top it would be an engagement... which is soon to come!","label":1}
{"text":"Graduation is a time to celebrate achievement. It is the end of a chapter in life and the beginning of another chapter. While I was glad my studies were finished, I felt saddened that this part of my life was over. If someone would have told me freshman year that I would feel this way come graduation day, I would have called them crazy. But here it was, graduation made me sad. I didn't even pick up my cap and gown because I knew that I would not attend. I wasn't sure about the next step in my life or what all of my work really meant. It didn't feel like much of a celebration. A classmate sent some of the photos her and her family took of graduation. I looked at the picture of her in between her parents. There was another picture of the football field, full of chairs and the crowd looking out at the graduates. As much as I am happy for her, I wanted to forget about school. I felt alone because everyone else was so happy. She wasn't the only classmate that reached out to me. I heard from a guy I took English Composition with and my roommate from sophomore year. My former roommate told me about the night that she wanted to drop out of everything. She said that if I hadn't been there to support her, things would be different not only for her, but her family. I got several texts from senior seminar classmates thanking me for being a great team member, for helping them study. I am glad that I could avail myself to so many people and that something I did mattered.  Still, I did not regret my decision to attend graduation and that this part of my life is over.","label":0}

We never really had an idea what was coming. On arrival at the hospital, the Doctor examined her and told us it was time. I was shocked as we didn't come for delivery but rather for a hospital checkup. She was admitted and I drove back home to bring her stuffs.

My wife and I went into an immediate panic and started texting each other. Unable to wait and wanting to know what the issue was, my wife texted immediately. She let us know that we would be needing to find new daycare and that she is closing down. We would have 2 weeks to find something new including over the holiday weekend which drastically limiting the time we had. This was terrible unexpected after roughly 4 years of watching our daughter. Really wish we had month or more and not right as school is about to begin. We immediately began reaching out to daycare providers and to no avail they have all been full. So far that was an entire day while working trying everything from social media to find a safe place for our daughter to be while we work. This drove both of our stress levels out the rough and has made the day very difficult. This is just one of those things that happens unexpectedly but I truly hope for the best.

Then we met up with her friends, and I got to meet their cats. We went to the fireworks show, and the music selection was as bad as if someone had just searched for the acronym \"USA\" in a bunch of songs and set fireworks to the results. The fireworks were cool, though. On the way back to the train station, I felt like I needed to talk about the anxiety that I had been having lately. After listening to my experiences, she asked if I was okay, and talked about what she does to handle her anxiety. I was worried about having a panic attack on the train that night, so she drove me home instead, even though that was kind of expensive for her. She sent me a guide to some of her methods for helping with anxiety through text later. I felt so comforted by knowing that she dealt with that, too. I felt like someone was looking out for me, and I felt like the place I lived in felt like home. As opposed to my parent's home, which didn't feel like home with the 4th of July thing.

After buying it the owner had said they always have the brides name the dresses they buy. My mom and I thought this was strange but cute enough.

Needed me to pretend to be her cousin Jim because some sleeze ball wouldn't leave her alone. Ended up talking and her name was Vanessa. Talked about any and everything honestly. What she thinks of politics ( I like to get that out of the way ahead of time), what her view is on whiskey, how she likes her eggs cooked. I'm gonna be honest, that's a big thing for me because runny eggs are awful. Anyway, we've been talking this whole time off and on. Random text messages, like the one I got rubbing in mu face that the Patriots finally lost. I had told her I thought Brady would do one more superbowl before retiring, but I guess hindsight is 20\/20.

{"text":"About a week ago i decided to drive up to the mountain, take my class and attempt the summit of Mount Hood. Although, I must say things were not looking all that good as far as the weather goes and leading up to our trip there were a few bumps in the road. I was packed, lunches and dinners were packed, so we were pretty much ready to go at this point. My wife went with me to keep me company when I wasn't on the mountain. There was just a couple of problems, we were going to get a few groceries before we left and the night prior, we were in a rush to get to work and forgot the list. Not to mention, I had forgotten to give my pager back before I left work. Not just any pager, but the pager that is reserved for medical emergencies at the hospital. So we made a trip back in (about a 1 hour drive, round trip) to return the pager and to get our groceries. By this time we were very tired, we had both worked a twelve hour shift prior to this and we were hoping to leave by around 3pm or 4 pm. This did not happen. We did not get home until about 1pm, so we were going to sleep until about 5 o'clock. Well we didn't get on our way until about 9pm. Arriving at the hotel at about 1am on Tuesday Morning, we were exhausted. Sleep came fairly quickly, knowing that I had to be up early the same morning to meet Brett at our hotel and and to take our beginner snow skills class. Climbing up the South Side of Mount HoodMeeting our guide and deciding whether or not to climb - Brett and I arrived early with plenty of time to meet Joe, our guide. Joe gave us an introduction of himself and his experience, checked our gear, asked us about our experience with climbing, had us sign the waivers that say if we die that they cannot be held liable. He then gave us the option, due to questionable weather to postpone the summit day for another time with better weather or to go ahead and try anyways the next day. After a short discussion, we decided to go ahead with it. After all we didn't want to have to make another long drive up to the mountain, and even if we didn't make the summit, we would still gain some experience, albeit expensive. Onward to the class we went. We learned how to kick steps, plunge step, self arrest techniques, traversing and the french step. We also learned several knots and proper roped travel. I must say I'm glad we drove up to Vermont last week. I saw beautiful foliage by a lake, in a field and from a gondola ride to the top of a mountain.","label":0}

The memories we had and the growing we did in that house will never be forgotten. Now it is time to move on to the next chapter in our life. We are looking for a new home. We are even thinking about adding to our family. It may be another dog. Who knows, it maybe a child. We need something bigger and closer to the city. We understand it will be a risk from leaving what we know. We are ready for the adventure. We will need to make sure it's within our budget. We will need an extra room for company.

Their tickets are so high or they are playing so far from where i live, and now, I actually am holding in my hand, 2 tickets ON THE FLOOR to see them that I WON!! I cannot believe it.  Problem is the tickets are for NYC and I am in Mass.  Im kinda afraid of NYC..never been to a city like that before. I mean i have been to Boston a time or two, but NY. i Don't know.  A friend is going with me, and we can take the train in so it wont be too much money, but still, neither of us have been there so we will need to figure out how to get to the stadium from where our train stops, and do this without getting mugged!  So many stories i hear about that city!  I already super nervous...but super excited at the same time!!We have maps and GPS on our phone.  We have extra money in case cabs or uber is needed.  We will pack snacks in back packs.  Hmm i wonder if they allow those in the arena? I better look that up!  This is going to be quite a trip!  I can hardly wait!","label":0}

G felt that I was the one who was doing all the day to day helping with doctor's appointments and taking care of stuff at home. So the pasrt she felt she could best play considering she was rarely in our home state was to provide a trip to a warm place with a beach. This is exactly what D wanted. It was the first trip after D started treatment and it would just be the three of us. I felt lucky that this trip was provided by G. No matter what, it was going to be hard. I knew D atleast felt like she could be real about her frustrations and fears. When we arrived, it was truly the most luxurious place I had been in, which isn't important by itself. Obviously most people couldn't afford this and it's not the only way to deal with this diagnosis. But for three women who grew up not having access to this, it was pretty amazing. G wanted to place to be a surprise so only gave D and me the address but not the name of the hotel. Everything was made out of recycled material, the suite was stunning with a beautiful view. There were several pools to pick from as well as the ocean. Every night we would walk around town and pick places to have a drink. The memories of going on this trip are something I'll always be grateful for.","label":1}

Both side of the family were yelling at us.   We felt really bad afterwards and apologized like crazy.   Nonetheless, both our families ignored us for a month so we decided to have another wedding.

Right now, we are trying to figure out how to get forgiveness from our parents.  This is actually more stressful than the wedding itself.","label":0}

Every night we  make camp fires before going to bed. Two days into camping, we started hearing gunshot in the evening. Everyone was scared and i armed myself to protect myself and my kids. We were curious until the rangers came by and told us everything is okay that it could be deer hunters or so. We were told we are secured and that was how we were able to sleep during night. it was such an interesting camping and we all enjoyed it because we had a nice time meeting few families too.","label":0}

I had some savings for a situation such as this, but my funds were beginning to run low. I had rent to pay and groceries to buy, but I was beginning to become very stressed as my bank accounts were quickly approaching zero. This hit point break when my balance was finally down to two figures. I wouldn't be able to afford any of my upcoming expenses. Having reached total desperation, I reached out to my fairly estranged brother. We hadn't been close since before our parents had both passed away, but I had no other choice. I called him and was greeted with a cold, uncaring tone. I explained the situation to him and was on the edge of my seat waiting for his response. His reply was one of complete apathy. He said he had no obligation to take care of somebody just because they were related and that he had his own problems to deal with. I was shocked, but completely unsurprising at the same time. He had always been very selfish and self-interested, but I thought just maybe this would create a single act of decency from him.

Since birth I helped partially raise her from birth and have very strong memories of her childhood. The wedding was very nice, nothing over the top and expensive but it looked really nice.  I didn't know her soon to be husband too well but seemed very nice and polite.  After talking with most people I then took my seat. When the music started and she was talking down the aisle, it kind of emotional for me. My little girl was grown up.  The ceremony was like most but my attention was mainly focused on my niece. She was so pretty and I knew that special bond was gone.  I had a feel she would be happy. They were both standing up there and really seemed to be so excited. As the ceremony was closing I felt a way of joy it me. As I've had a long term relationship, I know how happy she could truly be. As it finished ad she was walking back down the aisle, she glanced over at me. At that moment, I could feel a tear running down my face. I guess this was the emotion conclusion to everything that has built up to this point. She is grown up, a woman, and married which I wish her all the best.","label":1}

The man upstairs who rented it to me was an alcoholic and he would play his music at stadium level volume and it was very awful to endure.  After almost a year of that, including being harassed non stop for not speaking Spanish, I was able to find another place in a different city away from the man and his awful habits. It only took a day to move out, since I do not have much stuff. I was able to move in with a friend, and my boyfriend and things are much better here. I have personal privacy now, whereas I did not before. I didn't even have a bedroom before in the basement. I had to sleep on the concrete floor with spiders and centipedes around. I hated it and I am glad I was able to move. I am not as depressed and anxious as I was before. I was always getting harassed by Hispanic people for being American and not speaking Spanish. There is no one here that harasses me now. I am currently trying to save up for my own place so that I do not have to deal with roommates ever again.

He was cream colored and his 11 other siblings were playing boisterously on top of him. Next scene, there he was again, everyone piled on top of him. Instantly I knew, he is the one. My husband and I took home home, it cost us $60 and he came completely full with fleas!I called the vet and begin my monumental task of getting rid of the fleas. It was very tedious, and time consuming. We called him Ash, after the Pokemon master, my children favorite show. I taught him to sit, roll over, high fives, shake hands and we played hide and seek for hours. He was very energetic and frisky. He would run over to me from wherever, when I said the word,  \u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00baready\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b9.

We would argue a lot. We had different friend groups. That was that. This was about 10 years ago. We were both musicians growing up. I played rock music in a band and she was always practicing classical violin. We never paid much attention to each other due to this difference in stylistic taste. When she went to music school 2 months ago I knew she would broaden her musical tastes, and I supported her work. I was extremely surprised last week at her concert. Her jazz band played music that was very angular and dynamic the way that certain rock music is. I asked her about this. She said that she ended up with some members in her band that had rock music tastes like me. She was able to see that as something they had in common to make music about.

She was visiting not long ago, and naturally religion came up in conversation. My wife and I were taking her school shopping, and she is actually the one who brought up something she thought was derogatory to women in the bible. That opened up the conversation because I was able to explain what the scripture actually meant. She was hesitant to listen at first, but I could tell that I had piqued her interest. She quickly changed the subject after my explanation because she didn't like the true meaning rather than the meaning she and her friends had chosen to believe because they took the scriptures out of context. That was okay though. She is a smart kid, and I know she is going to ponder on what I told her. I don't push religion on her at all because I know she puts those walls up.

Brian lives a few cities over so we don't see him often, but he gathered all of our best friends from high school for a huge BBQ. There wasn't a chance in the world that we would miss it. Not only that but unbeknownst to us, they all pitched in for a massive 3-foot surprise birthday cake for us. It had military action figures on all sides, and was both chocolate and vanilla flavors at different levels. I even saw oreos and peanut butter cups on there, which are my two favorite snacks. Lately we have been talking on the phone a lot about me being deployed, so it was touching to receive such a big cake. I know Brian's brother served multiple tours a while back, so he understands what it means when a deployment is looming. Aside from the crazy cake, we had tons of food on his new industrial sized grill. He bought three types of burgers, tons of brats, hot dogs, and all the vegan options available. In addition we had at least a half dozen large coolers filled beer and water. As we chatted with old friends long into the night, I couldn't help but remember how great some of the times we used to have were. It would be a shame if our friends didn't get together like this after all we've been through, and it's especially important that we are all able to make time for the group.

{"text":"Last week I invited some friends of mine to attend a class on love and yoga. During the class we began discussing the meaning of love, how it manifests itself in relationships and how it is seen within the universe. One of the things about the class that impressed me was the teacher's clarity that love is undefined and unconditioned. nit does not fluctuate much like the human conception, but instead it is a powerful force that can be said formed the universe. After the class we all had a chance to talk and converse what was shared. My friends were overjoyed that I would invite them to such a program because it was something that touched the hearts of all of us. Some people felt love was like An ocean in which we all swam or floated or drowned. Others felt that love was like a tree that ascended towards the heavens and humbled itself deep into the earth. Then there were some that felt love was a hummingbird that sought nectar from all of life. I could not help but agre with all three sentiments and feel that love takes many forms. some of these forms are seen in relationships between two people. Another form is between a parent and a child. There is also the form of love between friends which is most equal. There also exists a form of love between a teacher and a student. One can also see love between animals that care for their young or their mate. Love appears in many forms indeed. My feeling is that it's best to express rather to repress ones love. It's best to follow ones love.","label":1}

{"text":"About five months ago, I decided to become a court appointed special advocate. CASA for short. I really love children, and with my background in pediatric nursing, I thought I would do a good job representing the abused and unloved ones in court. Well, as it happens, I did too good a job. My first child to represent was a four year old girl who had been physically abused by her drug addicted parents. My heart went out to this beautiful child, and I just resented her parents so much. I really bonded with her when we were meeting prior to the court date. Even though she is only four, I really could feel her emotional pain and despair from being raised by parents who loved drugs more than her. I spoke for her at the custody trial in which I was attempting to get her away from her parents and into foster care. I guess I really was able to let the judge understand the girl's despair and unending pain she suffers in her home, because the judge did take the child away from her parents. He granted custody to me. The judge said that it was clear the child had emotional and behavioral issues, and also clear that she had formed a strong bond with me. I was to be her foster parent. I was in total shock. I am glad to be an advocate, but honestly just want to focus on my career, and have no intention of having children right now. I guess God has other plans, though, because the girl went home with me that day after court. She and I have been living together for about 3 months now, and I am loving every minute of it. Every day, I feel like I learn something new about being a parent and a friend. I am able to see this child blossom into a beautiful healthy, well adjusted child, and I know I am the reason for that.

{"text":"Three months ago i moved out of my parents home. I decided to get an apartment with my girl friend.  This really helped my mental health out very much.  It made life much easier having a place to ourselves and i was very nice.  I remember the moving process was a pain but in the end it was worth it.  It really helped me look at life in a more positive way.  If you work hard you will get the things that you want in life. I worked very hard to move out of my parents house and now i finally did it.  This was a huge jump start in my life.  This made me very proud to have worked so hard to move out. I had to save thousands of dollars and it was well worth it.  It helped my mental health because it made me grow up.  It made me see life in a  different way than i did before. It helped my girlfriend and i grow closer.  We are now engaged and i think the move helped.","label":0}
{"text":"I went for a run this morning, and I couldn't finish.  My knee was really hurting.  There was no ignoring it this time.  I had noticed the knee pain from time to time the last few months.  I initially chalked it up to the increase in my distance running since I was prepping for a half marathon.   I was starting to worry that I had a small tear in a tendon or possibly had done some serious damage to my kneecap the last time I fell while running in the rain.  I decided that I needed to call a doctor and have it checked out.  My regular doctor was able to get me in the next day, first thing in the morning.  He instructed me not to take painkillers or do anything that might effect the actual issue I was dealing with.  Normally, the pain went away relatively quickly, but not this time.  I was DYING to use some ICY HOT, or take some Advil.  As promised, the doc saw me at 9am bright and early - I had never been so happy to see him.  He ran some tests, took some blood, wrenched my knee this way and that until it brought tears to my eyes.  He also ran an extra AND took an Ultrasound.  All this uncertainty had me extremely worried.   He said he thought I had arthritis, but really wanted me to see an orthopedic doctor to confirm.  At 33, he felt I was really awful young and healthy to be worried about arthritis.   I was shuttled to the other side of the hospital offices to meet with the ortho doc.   He did, in fact, confirm that I had Osteoarthritis in my knee.   There really is no CURE or treatment, only a way to calm the symptoms.  I felt really defeated.  I loved to run - it was my source of stress relief and made me feel so good about myself.   The doctor suggested I cut back to my old running routine, and put the half marathon on hold - apparently by giving my knee a break and boosting bone strengthening vitamin intake - my knee might bounce back later.   But in my mind,...all I could imagine was being 45 and walking with a cane.  I mean, if it is already starting at my age - I didn't like to think about what the future would hold.","label":0}

{"text":"I've had a savings account that I put extra money in for years. First it was just extra money that I had left over from birthday gifts and holiday gifts. When I got older and started working I added money from my paycheck that I didn't need to use at the time. The money was a lifesaver after I got married and had some kids. Sometimes when I don't have enough money in pay check from work I used my savings money to pay for bills. Fortunately, for the most part my job is stable enough that I was able rely on that money in order to pay for necessities in life. I also loved using that money for anything that my kids needed. It always felt so great to be able to use some extra money for the kids that didn't come out of my regular money and wouldn't affect my budget too much. The biggest reward of the whole thing, of course, was to see their smiling faces when I gave them a wonderful present that they had been so hopeful for. Then, three months ago, tragedy struck! For some odd reason my husband decided that he needed that money more than me and the kids. He just took half of the money out of my savings account without telling me or giving me any sort of reason! He's been completely evasive about the whole situation since it's happened and has never given me any sort of reasoning for doing that. It's upset me tremendously since I've lost so much money that I worked so hard to collect. Worse than that is that I can't buy my kids all of the things that they want and they completely deserve which depresses me since now I don't get to see their faces light up with joy when I do give them a present. Fortunately I am still working and generally money itself is not too much of a problem but this whole situation has been a giant drain on me and my life. It's just very frustrating and upsetting to think that someone who supposedly loved me so much and was raising our kids would just do this to us. I think about putting more money towards my savings account so I can rebuild what I had but then I'm not sure if I would have enough money to cover the regular bills and other daily necessities. I can't really explain what happened to my kids because they idolize him so much that they would never be able to understand this and they would just ask me a million questions that I can't answer. I would love answers myself because I truly just have no idea about anything that's been going on here. 4","label":0}

Something happened last minute, and she wasn't able to come. I was sad, and laid in my bed for a while because I had been so excited for her to come. There was a knock on my door. I opened it, and not only was it my mom--who tricked me--but my dad and my older brother. They had all flown in to surprise me! I was so surprised. My mom told me she had been able to get a cheaper flight and my dad was able to get off work, so they wanted to come in secretly. When my brother found out, he also wanted to be part of the fun. I was so happy to see them, but I also didn't know where they would stay, since I have a studio apartment. We got an air mattress and my brother slept there, while I slept on the couch. The weekend in LA was so great, and I had such a wonderful time hanging out with my family. I took them to all of my favorite places, and we just had a lot of really good bonding time.

I guess I am blessed to have the friends and family I have. Three months ago I was telling my son that I just couldn't manage the farm and keep up with all the projects that needed to be done. The next day a whole gang of friends and family showed up. They built the prefab carport and greenhouse that I had ordered a year ago and had just been laying there in boxes and on top of that they prepped my garden for the next round of planting. I know now I can count on those close to me for help when I really need it and I don't need to give up my farm and life to this horrible illness. I really see God's hand in this. It makes me love my family and friends even more. On some level because I was sick I didn't think I deserved to be able to stay here. I know I can ask for help now.

Usually for me that means I had some amazing food at some super trendy brunch place with artisanal waffles or something, but I honestly can't remember the food this time. I remember getting up early that day and starting to pour some cereal, and my wife stopped me and said we should go out instead. I thought that was odd since it was so last minute, and we got dressed really quick to head out the door to the corner diner. Before I could get through placing my order, my wife just blurted out \"I'm pregnant\" with this huge smile on her face. She couldn't contain herself or even wait for us to get to the meal. The waitress, Rita, squealed with delight, and I jumped up and we all three embraced. We've been trying for quite some time, and this was such great news. We spent the whole breakfast planning out our future and talking about how this would change everything for the better. Our waitress gave us some tips on parenting as she has children of her own. My wife got a little sad at the end because she had imagined this big fancy way of telling me and this was so rushed and last minute instead. I told her it was perfect, because it was perfect. This was such a surprise as we'd both almost given up hope, and the way she told me was just so filled with joy and surprise that it fit so well with the surprise we'll be expecting soon. I want to tell more people than just our new waitress friend Rita, but it's too early for that. We've started talking about baby names, but if it's a girl, I'm pulling for Rita.","label":0}

Well, Shelly did make an interesting comment that his behavior sounded like a character in a romance novel she was reading. I tried to get her to say more, but she seemed to regret the comment. Well, I had errands to run so after meeting with my friends, I stopped at Costco, Walmart, and Starbucks for some overpriced coffee. This all happened two weeks ago and my life will never be the same. Well, the errands ended up taking less than I expected. So I got home earlier than I'd told my husband I would. I parked in the driveway and started carrying in the groceries. My husband didn't bother to help carry them in which really annoyed me.

It was a busy and emotional time for all of us.  As we left it was surprising to see my son being emotional and not wanting to let go of his hug. I was very touched by this and tried not to cry.  Our daughter on the other hand was off and running and could'nt get rid of us fast enough. I returned to a quiet house with the dogs wondering where everyone had gone.  It was now just me and my husband.  We will now be able to do what we want to do for dinner and sit where we want to watch what we want on the big screen TV.  I am not so sure I like it.

{"text":"My most memorable moment in my life was Thanksgiving in 2017. It was the first Thanksgiving I had with my whole family since I was in my early 20's. It came a few months after my mother had a stroke. I come from a fairly large family (3 brothers and three sisters) so it was interesting to have us all under one roof with our now husband\/ and or wives and our children. It was not one moment of calm, it was total chaos and way too much energy for me. Especially the fact that I am a bit of a hypochondriac and my family and I were on an airplane for nearly 6 hours. Not too mention going to a climate that is much dryer and much more hotter and or coldrer depending on the time of day that where we live. I found myself feeling ill and just wanting to rest the whole time. Unfortunately with so many people in one big house there was no time for that. We managed to have an enjoyable time. We cooked together, watched movies together. The kids got off of their devices for a short time and actually played board games. I purchased my mom a champagne cake made by an award winning bakery (very expensive) because her birthday was in mid November. We were all very happy, and were appreciative that my mom is still with us. That week was the most memorable because it was a fun family time and I am not sure when it will happen again.","label":0}

He was still happy, friendly, and full of life. The doctor told us he had about a year to live, if he didn't make a full recovery. Our hopes were high, and we were hoping for the best. So was Spot. He knew he could over come it. But then the worst happened. Spot threw up about 3 or 4 times that morning. We knew something was up, so we took him to the vet. He spent his last waking moments on the vet bed. The doctor examined Spot, and told us that the cancer had spread throughout his body. Spot would not make it much longer. With heavy hearts, we decided to put Spot out of his misery, and let him go on to a better place. The doctor put Spot down, with all of us surrounding him for his last moments.","label":0}

{"text":"So about 15 months ago, I went out one evening with a group of guys for a guys night out.  We all talked about only having a couple drinks, but of course, most adults know that a few, means more than a few.  I ended up staying out a lot longer than I thought I would, drank way more than I really wanted to, and woke up with a killer craving, which of course, was hang over food.  I really wanted breakfast food at this point as well, so why not decide to go to IHOP? It was actually a 15 minute drive for me, as oppose to Dennys which was just down the street from my house, but for some reason, I wanted to upgrade to IHOP and I went with it.  I am absolutely amazed at how everything goes down, but it was at that IHOP where I met the woman that I knew I would eventually marry. I was sat down in a booth, that of course would normally have about 4 people in it, but it was just me.  Sitting at the next table, was this gorgeous, red haired woman.  Our eyes met, and she gave me the cutest little smile and looked back down at the newspaper she was reading. I waited, and was trying to get over how stunning this woman was, before I finally got up and decided to introduce myself and invite her to my table for some conversation.  She looked surprised, and asked really? Of course really, and I asked her if I could carry her coffee cup over, and she said yes and gathered her jacket and purse and came to sit with me.  We talked about everything from our careers, to our families, and even our heart aches. What was most surprising, was that she also was coming in that morning after a night out with her girlfriends who all were to hung over to get breakfast. We sat there for over 3 hours.  It felt like 15 minutes.  Not many people are lucky enough in their lifetime to make a connection such as this.  I thought she was stunning when I first saw her, now I just couldn't envision my life without her in it.  I thought I was crazy.  This is way to fast to have these feelings, or could love at first site be a real thing?  I don't know, but I wasn't going to questions it.

I, being the older brother and in control of things had to accept that the baby be kept in the house with us while they both worked harder to pay for an apartment of their own and care for their baby. 6 months later, Mary put to bed and behold, it was a glorious sight unknowing to them that was the beginning of all trouble. i really couldn't stop him as it was a means to more income in the house. soon after, Mary found out about Mark's new found love with his boss at his work place and confronted him.

It's always a fun time when they're over and usually my mother and I like taking them to go grab some quick grub from wherever they're feeling like to that day. We loaded up the guys and went on our way. As we were leaving I felt a bump under the rear tire but thought nothing of it as we live on a dirt road and there's always big rocks shifting and whatnot. We got their food and ice cream and headed back home so they could eat comfortably. When arrived to the house I saw now what I thought was a mere rock was in fact my cat, Patches. I quickly drove around it's body and helped bring the kids in because I didn't know how they would react. I was still in shock at this moment as I couldn't accept what I had done. I still can't get the image of her lifeless body just laying there. I did this, no one else but me. I was not careful enough and just kept on driving without checking if there was anything around. Of course both kids couldn't stay inside without curiosity getting the better of them and came outside as I had picked her up and moved here until I found a suitable place to bury her. They questioned what had happened and I am not one to make up stories\/fantasies and told them what happened. I had this cat since before either of my niece and nephew were born. While she was getting old, she was still always full of life. To my surprise they told me that everything was going to be okay and that accidents happen.

{"text":"In the months that followed I often found myself recalling those songs in my head during times of depression. When I started to feel depressed or detached I would consult my virtual playlist of childhood songs and allow myself to drift away and become immersed in the happy feelings that immediately followed. I was shocked at how well it worked and how long the effects lasted. I even went so far as to download the songs and play them when my memory of them would fade. I also use them as ringtones for my close family and friends. This has made a noticeable difference in my mood upon answering their calls. Since I've been using the Disney songs as a therapy of sorts, my friends and family have noticed a change. I have accomplished tasks that I had no interest in achieving and I have a new hold on my emotions. Just yesterday I got some news that would have been very depressing in the past.

I was thinking how in the world would I even live without him if he had passed on. These were horrible thoughts in my head! It all started when my dad started to feel ill. He said he was feeling week and a little shakey. I told him to go to bed for a little bit and maybe he'd feel better after a nap. He laid down, but an hour later he got back up and told me \"I think I need to go to the hospital.\" I asked him if he was feeling better, he said he was feeling worse and would feel better going to the hospital. I got dressed and got him dressed and we went to the hospital.

She told him, \"I think you both should be prepared to spend the night tonight. I get a hunch that this is serious.\" and I looked at her and said \"What do you mean?\" and she said she'd get a doctor to explain everything. The doctor came in about 5 minutes later and said they were going to take my father down to do some tests and then asked him how he was feeling and he mumbled \"Not good.\" So they took him out and the doctor stayed with me and explained everything and how he might have had a heart attack, but won't know until he does the tests. I asked if it was serious and he said \"It could be.\" Turns out, he had had one and was getting what they said was \"kick backs\" from the first attack. The tests showed that it was worse than expected and my dad had to be wheeled into surgery for quintuple bypass surgery . I was so nervous for him, this was the most serious thing he had ever been through and it was scary for us all.

I scritched and chatted for almost an hour and, by the end, I had all but adopted the cat.  I took him home with me that day, borrowing a carrier from the rescue group to transport him.  Although the first few weeks were rough, he integrated well with my other cats.  The other young cat hid from him for quite some time, spending almost entire days under the couch and staring at me with eyes that said \"Who this guy in my space?\"  Eventually she snuck out to sniff him before darting away and, one day, I woke up to find them both on the bed.  Opposite corners, to be sure, but together on the bed!  It was a great relief to see everyone be happy.  I named him Kismet for the twist of fate that brought him to me.

He looked so strange, it was him and yet not him I watched as some of my family broke down into tears, some quietly. Others held it in. I felt I had to be strong for my own little family. My children will never again get to see their grandpa. I will never again get to see my dad, yet as a dad, I couldn't let me kids watch me break down completely. After today, all that will be left him is his belongings and his ashes.","label":1}
{"text":"Marriage is between one man and one woman. Many people today have decided that they no longer adhere to the God-created image of marriage and will be in a relationship and\/or marry any one or any thing that they desire. This type of behavior shows that they do not believe in the truth that God has given us since the beginning of time. They have placed themselves as God in their own lives.","label":1}
{"text":"Two month ago, I took my fiance on a over night trip to watch a play in Louisville. We had been dating for a bout a year and I knew that we were meant to be together. Since we have dated there have been things happen in our life that have brought us closer together. We celebrated her new job and we mourned the death of my father. After he passed it really put life in perspective and I knew that I wanted a family. I decided to visit my friend who owns a jewelry store and selected the perfect ring. It was a little over 2 carats but worth every cent. When we arrived in Louisville we checked into our hotel room and then had dinner at Jeff Ruby's Steak House. The meal was delicious and the view was even better. We decide to walk next door to the performing arts center and have a few cocktails before the show. We took our seats in a private balcony and when the first half was over the magic began. I got down on my knee and proposed to my future wife. She cried and I let a few tears slip myself. The crowd began clapping when they realized what was happening and it was the perfect moment. Now we have to plan our wedding and that may be a little more stressful.","label":0}

{"text":"Two months ago, the best day of my life happened. I should start with some backstory. I met my girlfriend in 2017, we had some mutual friends and became friends through them. We instantly hit it off and started a great friendship. That quickly evolved into a romantic relationship within about a month and we began dating in August of 2017. We have had a pretty incredible relationship, obviously not perfect but we always come out of situations on top, together. I knew that I wanted to marry her pretty early into our relationship, but I also knew it was something that I didn't want to rush into. She didn't want to rush into it either. We very much wanted to take our time getting to know one another and just enjoying our lives together. Earlier this year, I decided I wanted to propose on our two year anniversary, and I started getting things set up to do so. I picked out the ring with the help of her sister, who is her best friend, and got on with planning the proposal. I decided the most important place to us would be the perfect place to propose, and that's at a local park where we shared our first kiss. In order to ensure that she didn't suspect anything, I had her sister suggest to her that we go on a double picnic date in that park with her and her husband before we went for our anniversary dinner alone later that night. We would then take some photos together as a group and just the two of us. Since she believed it was her sister's idea, my girlfriend suspected absolutely nothing. When it came time, my girlfriend's sister suggested that my girlfriend and I pose for a couples photo, and as we were stood next to each other, I stepped back, got down on one knee and proposed. She was shocked and overjoyed, and after realizing what was happening, jumped into my arms and said yes. It was one of the happiest moments of my life, knowing that I will be spending the rest of my life with this woman. I know our wedding day will top this, but it was such an amazing day that we will never forget.","label":1}
{"text":"Three months ago my youngest son learned he was going to his first choice university. He had been wanted to get into Princeton for a long time. I had told him I would cover the cost if he could get in. He has been working very hard to keep his grades up. He has studied extra after school and on the weekends. He has a good work ethic. When I helped him put in the application Princeton I was not expecting he would be accepted to go to go Princeton. Getting into Princeton is not easy. Princeton is a highly selective university. He did well on the SAT. I read his essay and thought it was well done. I planned a nice day for his birthday.  I made a cake. On his birthday, I went to get the mail and notice Princeton University on one envelope. I took it to my son. I watch as he opened it. It read he was accepted to both our surprises.","label":0}
{"text":"About 3 months ago I noticed a letter on the door. When I opened it, it was from my landlord stating that the property has been sold. This immediately made me nervous because it was out of nowhere. I've always considered myself lucky because I'm in a growing area in the city. I'm very close to downtown and luxury homes. I knew the day was coming but just wasn't expecting it to be so soon. My rent increased $300 which has been hard for me to afford. Ever since then, it has pushed me to look into buying a house. The fact that my apartments were sold has made major changes for me in life. Especially since I have children. When you have children, you have to think about the safety of neighborhoods. Not only that, but changing schools would be such a pain since the school year is about to begin. The past couple of months have been difficult in trying to save money. I have to do this while also spending money on food, bills, and my children's necessity. Also, the house buying process is long and difficult.","label":1}

{"text":"About eight months ago, my wife and I had an epiphany. We  always had both always dreamed of opening up our own store. Both of us were sick of having a boss over our shoulder. We figured it would be best to be our own boss and to sell what we wanted to the public. We both had been baking together as a hobby and had gotten quite good at it. In particular we made the best cheesecake either of us ever had. Many of our friends had suggested that we open a bakery in the past. We figured it was finally time. First step was to find a storefront. Luckily I had a friend who was moving and owned a small diner. He said he would sell to us cheap. Now for additional expenses. We needed new baking equipment, so I went to the bank to take out a loan. Initially the bank had turned us down and I was pretty upset about it. But the next day we had gotten a phone call saying that after reviewing our information we would get the loan after all. We were both really happy in today we have a slowly growing bakery. Are cheesecake being the number one selling item.","label":0}

{"text":"It's against the law to commit suicide and we should not allow anyone, no matter how much pain they may be in to have that option. We should be treating these people who are thinking about euthanasia with mental help and assistance to get them back to a healthier mind set. It goes against everything in the Bible to take your own life and you will not be going to Heaven, which shows you are not making the right choice. You should not have the power to make those decisions and trained doctors and hospital should not be assisting people in ending their lives, but they should focus on their main objective and helping those people. We need to make this illegal because people cannot think they have the power to just end things when they want. It's ridiculous and immoral that we would allow anyone to help someone else end their life especially since kids are dying of cancer and haven't lived. We cannot support murdering our own people!","label":0}

{"text":"This summer I had the opportunity to take my youngest daughter to Disney World. She is four years old and obsessed with princesses and Mickey and Minnie Mouse. This was to be a magical opportunity. Unfortunately in the time leading up to  the trip, two  things happened to get in the way of successful travel. First, my oldest daughter who is mentally ill had to be admitted to a long-term residential program. She was originally supposed to come on the trip with us but now this would no longer be possible. There was also the added stress of needing to be near by her while she was hospitalized and my anxiety about traveling during this time. The second  event was a back surgery, desperately needed, scheduled for my husband just twelve days before we were set to depart. He had his surgery and it went well, but he developed a hematoma and was in terrible paid. Despite this, we decided we didn't want to miss out on this opportunity. My oldest daughter was disappointed she couldn't go, but we promised her a makeup trip and she felt better. I was able to visit with her right before we left. We drove to Orlando and rented my husband a motorized scooter to get around. Despite his discomfort, my husband agreed that this vacation was well worth it. It was such a joy to see our four year old girl enraptured by the magic all around her. It was Disney's most crowded day of the year and we were under a heat advisory but we kept a positive attitude, made the best of a bad situation, and had an amazing time.","label":1}
{"text":"This past Spring, I lost my dad. My husband and I had been serving as primary caregivers for him in his home. One night very late, we heard him fall. We found him in the bathtub, where he had fallen face down after suffering a heart attack. I immediately called 911. My husband administered CPR while I was on the phone with emergency dispatch. When the paramedics came, they were able to revive Dad before transporting him to the hospital. But they warned us that he likely would not regain consciousness. Dad had an active DNR and we wanted to honor those wishes. Hospital staff advised that we get the family together to say goodbye. I was devastated. Icould not bring myself to go and watch my dad die. I stayed behind and my brother and sister met my husband at the hospital. They said their final goodbyes, though I doubt Dad heard their words. I haven't been able to reconcile the decision to stay home that night in my mind. To this day, it still pains me. I think about Dad often. I dream about him in happier times almost every night.","label":1}

{"text":"It was January,  2009, I experienced a traumatic experience on my very close friends wedding. My mother was driving my friend, me, and my brothers back home because the wedding was over. My youngest brother, my friend, and I, were in the backseat and my eldest brother was in the passenger seat. Every one was tips and we all lost controls in so many things at the wedding before we left but my mum insisted we leave because she had to o to work early the next dayAll of a sudden, the world went black. I opened my eyes moments later only to see my mother crying helplessly and weakly for help. I looked to my left, where my friend was, she was calling for her mother, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00baI want my mom, where is my mom?\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b9 and complaining that her shoulder hurt. I then looked to my right, and saw my little brother crying, and breathing harshly. My eldest brother, surprisingly was fine. He asked me if I was alright, and I responded by saying, my head hurts. My brother suddenly looked at the side of my face, and said \u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00baJade put your gloves on your face.\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b9I saw strange faces telling us to be calm and was helping us out of the car, When we were fully out of the car, my mom was still trapped inside. Her door had been caved in and she was unable to move. I shed a tear, then quickly ran and looked for help so i could reach 911 and luckily I got and the quickly arrived. I watched as the ambulance rushed her away, began to cry, and then realized that my little brother was standing right next to me. He was not breathing well and his face was beat red. My little brother is an asthmatic, so I immediately alerted a medic. We all followed them to the  hospital where we were each assigned a room, my friend and I were in a room together, and my brothers were each in their own rooms. At thatat point  I realized that you don\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t know how much you love someone, until they are fighting for their life just so they can live to see your face everyday. My mom is my idol. She has fought for her life in order to stay in mine and my siblings\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4. She has dumped guys she really liked, because she knows that when things are real bad, we are the ones that help her get through it the most. She has even gone days without eating so that we could eat. I look to my mom for everything, and am hoping she will be around for a long time. Death, can sweep you away in an instant. Some people just let it happen, but others are just too stubborn to give up.","label":0}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a nature walk three weeks ago. It was a lovely Saturday. It was raining the day before so all of the trees and plants were covered in a nice covering of dew. The leaves were glistening with water and the air was fresh. My husband talked about how much he was looking forward to the day. He had a difficult week but this was curing him. We walked to the main gazebo where we were going to have some berries. Along the way there we saw a few animals. The part was known to have a lot of various animas living there. The biggest animal we saw was a deer. It was with her little doe. The two were munching on some foliage in the distance. We then saw dragonflies near the gazebo. I remember catching them during the summer with my siblings when I was growing up. They bring back fond memories.","label":0}
{"text":"My younger brother and his wife had a baby about a week ago. I have never cared for, wanted or even liked children. I have never held a baby - I have never wanted to. They seem irritating and look like big nasty grubs. My wife and I have never wanted kids, we could not afford them, we both struggle with depression, and barely have enough time to make it through the day on our own. Also just having a forty-hour a week job prevents me from getting enough sleep as I should. I could not imagine functioning without sleep and caring for a child. So I was ambivalent about my brother have a kid and being an uncle. The day after he was born I went to the hospital to visit them out of politeness. His wife, my sister-in-law was asleep fro medication - she had to have a c-section, my mom and her mom were there. When I came in my mom was holding the baby, and she asked if I wanted to hold him. I figured I should. I sat down and they gently gave him to me. He seemed so light and he was sleepy. It was awkward holding him at first, my mom took a photo of me literally ten seconds after passes the child to me. A change came over me, I held this little child and I realized I care for him. I want to be a good uncle and want to see him succeed and I can't wait to buy him gifts. I think this is because the kid is a blood relative - he has my blood in him. People say that when I tell them I don't like kids - most say \"You'll like your own\". It's true, I can about my nephew. I could sleep that night when I heard he had to go to intensive care. Every thing was okay - just a normal test. So I went from almost despising children to loving one, and I think it's only because I can feel that he is a blood relative.","label":1}
{"text":"I came home from work a bit early since it wasn't busy, and I found my wife sitting at the dining room table.  This was a little strange, since I would usually find her on the couch watching television. She asked me to sit, which I figured could either mean good or bad news.  I obliged, and she set a pregnancy test on top of a paper towel that had been placed on the table in front of me.  It indicated that she was pregnant.  I wasn't sure how to feel.  I was excited, but nervous. This certainly was not a planned event. But regardless of how I felt, I needed to deal with it as best I could.  My take home pay was just enough to cover our existing lifestyle, and now I would have to purchase diapers, baby food, clothing, and all of the other baby-related items.  Our medical bills would increase.  It was stressful. However, I knew we could handle it, as we had before.  My job was quite flexible, and I could work more hours and bring home more pay.  My wife could work online - she was a medical transcriptionist before she quit to take care of our first child, and her company offered to keep her employed on a part-time basis if she ever needed the work.  It was a big life change, but I knew everything was going to be alright.","label":0}
{"text":"Less than a month ago, I moved into my first apartment. I had mostly lived with my parents my entire life, except for a short time in college. My boyfriend and I had been preparing to move for a few months, and waited for the call each month from the landlord who would tell us when an apartment became available. Finally, that call came in August that we could move into an open apartment in September. Each day leading up to the move, I'd either think about what I needed to pack or pack a few things in boxes. There wasn't much of an urgency until the day before. Things didn't seem real until moving day.  I woke up at 8 a.m. so I could meet the landlord at 9:30 a.m. It was extremely nerve-racking since the process was new to me. I arrived before my boyfriend and waited on the lobby couch. I spent the next ten minutes texting my friends and family.  My boyfriend finally entered the room and I was relieved. We began signing papers and getting all of that sorted out. We both were eager to finish that task so we could start the apartment walkthrough.  My first time walking into the apartment was surreal. I couldn't believe that I would be living with my boyfriend of two years and away from my parents. I looked around at the large space and still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u009a\u00c3\u0084\u00c3\u00b4t fathom that that was my new home. I waited for it to sink in. The  apartment had that \"new\" apartment smell of cleaning materials.  It was so empty at first, even with all the boxes and furniture. I'm still getting settled in. The only thing missing is my dog, who is still living with my family and I miss her dearly. I visit her a few times a week. We'll have her here with us as soon as we pay the very expensive pet deposit, and then I think things will feel more complete.","label":1}

{"text":"I understood when I started dating him, that my boyfriend was a football fanatic. Having grown up in small city in Texas, the heart of football country, I was familiar with boys like him. It was just my luck to have moved over a thousand miles away and still fall for someone who would have been at ease growing up in my hometown. I enjoy a good football game, but I'm not the type to go out to the stadium every Sunday. And with our home team spending the last several seasons, guarding the bottom of the standings, I made it clear that I would only go to games on a special occasions.  Having lived with my boyfriend for over a year and half, I could feel when something in our routine seemed to shift. I noticed he was on the phone more with his best friend. He normally took his calls in his little office\/man cave, rarely closing the door. In fact, I'm more likely to close it when he gets too noisy. Sometimes, you just can't help yourself. So many times I walked by his office and would be completely oblivious to what he was talking about. But this time a few weeks ago, I heard him say, \"That ring is going to be perfect.\" And that stopped me right in my tracks. Unfortunately those words were at the end of his conversation.  I back tracked to his office and tried to get some more information from him, but he would only say that he was \"just\" talking to his best friend. Sensing I was going to get anything else out of him with letting on that I may know something, I retreated from his office. I really didn't know how to feel at that moment. We both love each other and there were no real issues between the two us. It was just marriage was not something we'd spoke about yet. A little while later, I was in the kitchen making a smoothie for lunch, when he came strolling in. He seemed a bit nervous (or excited, still really can't figure which it was). He asked me if we had any plans the following Sunday. After confirming on our day-planner that we were free, he said to block the day for a football game. I readily agreed. Fast forward to the game and me watching his best friend propose to his girlfriend of 3 months at half-time.","label":0}

This was a job that I've held since I was 18 years old in a career that spanned over 30 years.  I wish I could say I saw it coming. To me personally, yes, but not for the entire staff- no!  We helped build this company for decades and to lose it over one contract is just unbelievable but that's the way the business was heading.  We did not diversify our portfolio enough and dependent on one contract basically to keep this place afloat.  It was not a lucrative contract by any means because the competition is very fierce and we could not perform and offer the things that were making other offers attractive.  It was a lot of discussion about cuts and how we could continue to move forward as a company without making some pretty severe adjustments.  However I don't believe I could really see our doors closing forever.  For me personally, it is going to be a very difficult time in my life.  I do not have the means or resources and I haven't saved enough money. I have gone through my 401k another for other reasons mostly.  Health issues and what not have put me in a rather precarious position.  But I'm not like any other people are going to feel this severe impact of losing their incomes.  Hopefully, my friends and the people that I get along with are going to be okay it's but it's going to be painful. For many others I suspect it will be devastating and they will need to figure out a way to recover maybe in an unconventional ways.","label":0}
