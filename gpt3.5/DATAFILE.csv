I decided that for awhile I will be a stay at home mom and take care of our two boys while they are in their younger years. I think my teaching background will help with this and make it a good experience for them. I was very sad to leave my job because I love my coworkers and students. My students have always been great, and they gave me little cards that they made to wish me good luck in the future and told me that they will miss me.

Used to our fights, I expected things to fall back into place in the next few weeks, since we could never stay away from each other for too long. That never happened. I reluctantly began going on dates with other people to try to move on and heal from your rejection, and you took that as a sign that I was seeking something or something else. I didn't know what else to do to try to fix something you didn't want anymore. Months later, we remain separated and rarely talk. It's still unbelievable to me because I never imagined we could go longer than a day without taking to each other. I have yet to tell my parents that it ended. I think that's because part of me is still holding on to hope that we'll work out. However, I'm simultaneously starting to accept that things are this way. Even though I still miss you, I no longer have the desire to tell you about everything that happens in my life. I no longer have the urge to talk to you all the time or think about you constantly. It's unfamiliar, but I guess this is what you wanted. I don't know the details of your life anymore and that's ok. In the end, I just hope we're both happy wherever we end up.

Friends and families getting together to share, and the children got to spend time with their friends. There was plenty of vegan inspired plates and platters! A personal favorite, is the steamed broccoli and tofu platter. Mm. Mm,Mm! The wife had her veggie burger on rye.

I immediately rushed down and calmed things down. While doing so, scolded the offenders. Out of no where came one of the parent of the kids. She barely asked for an explanation before going berserk.

It just wouldn't be the same without mom. Mom would always plan the family events, and it would be too hard without her there. But then my aunt reached out to me and suggested we still have a party. It made me feel special and made me think, it would be good to get the family together. Maybe it would help us each heal a little faster, having each other there for support. My family could see how much I was struggling, as they were, but they also helped me out financially and that made me feel really loved. When we had the party, I cried the morning of it. But then when everyone showed up, I felt great. I was relieved that I had family around. We ate cake and food and they sang to me. I opened up some nice presents, and one of them was a photo album with a lot of photos of all of us family members with my mom. We all cried together, but they were happy cries.

216,"It has been a decidedly difficult year for me. At the beginning of the year, my depression crashed into me like waves against an island shore during a storm. Even though mental illness is becoming less of a taboo subject in society, it still remains very stigmatized. In an effort to not scare my loved ones, I kept it mostly hidden from them. It took a large amount of effort to simply maintain my head above the water, and then something happened that would send me plummeting back into that murky, endless darkness. My grandfather died. It wasn't a necessarily unexpected death in the family. He was aging and had a string of visits to the hospital, which I'm sure added to the overwhelming amount of stress onto my mom's plate. Her father was important to her, anyone who saw them interact knew as much. Nonetheless, nothing really prepares you for the death of a loved one. Even more so if you haven't had the opportunity to see them in a very long time. Maybe that is why it hit me so hard, maybe it was the guilt from knowing he desperately wanted to see me and yet I couldn't find the time. It is something I wholly regret, and while everyone around me can tell me that surely he knew I loved him and to not beat myself up, I can't shake the feeling of remorse. I should have made the time, I should have had that one moment with him before I never would be able to again. Now I have only his tombstone to talk to, and as an Atheist, I think it makes it all that much more depressing. If there is no life after death, it means that this is it -- it is all I have left of him: fond memories and a tombstone.",memories,test,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

He liked working with his hands, but he knew that it would not be sustainable in the long run for his body and for his health. He still liked the possibilities of design and construction so he became an architecht. His ultimate dream was to build a house for us that he could be proud of.

218,"About five months ago, I decided to become a court appointed special advocate. CASA for short. I really love children, and with my background in pediatric nursing, I thought I would do a good job representing the abused and unloved ones in court. Well, as it happens, I did too good a job. My first child to represent was a four year old girl who had been physically abused by her drug addicted parents. My heart went out to this beautiful child, and I just resented her parents so much. I really bonded with her when we were meeting prior to the court date. Even though she is only four, I really could feel her emotional pain and despair from being raised by parents who loved drugs more than her. I spoke for her at the custody trial in which I was attempting to get her away from her parents and into foster care. I guess I really was able to let the judge understand the girl's despair and unending pain she suffers in her home, because the judge did take the child away from her parents. He granted custody to me. The judge said that it was clear the child had emotional and behavioral issues, and also clear that she had formed a strong bond with me. I was to be her foster parent. I was in total shock. I am glad to be an advocate, but honestly just want to focus on my career, and have no intention of having children right now. I guess God has other plans, though, because the girl went home with me that day after court. She and I have been living together for about 3 months now, and I am loving every minute of it. Every day, I feel like I learn something new about being a parent and a friend. I am able to see this child blossom into a beautiful healthy, well adjusted child, and I know I am the reason for that.

220,"About a month ago I decided to go on a road trip to the Niagara Falls and Toronto in general in Canada, I was driving from Kentucky, so it was a relatively descent little drive from my place to Toronto.  I decided to go all out when I got up there, since there was plenty of things to do I took my time and truly explored the region of Toronto in general.  The falls were truly breathtaking, and the water was quite cold since it was still winter time when I went.  Once I had my fill of the Falls I also checked out the Chinese cuisines that Toronto had to offer, and I was not disappointed, the food was truly amazing.  The vegetables were fresh, and crisp, while the rice was truly perfect, not too hard, and not too soft, but a good balance of firmness.  I also decided to see the CN tower, and was truly mesmerized by the sheer size of that structure, especially since it was right there, in downtown Toronto.  The sunset was also breathtaking and beautiful, but I don't think that is a strong enough word for how magnificent the sunset truly was.  I loved the trip because I do love exploring and just getting out and doing something different, exploring places I've never been before, and seeing the sheer beauty and raw power of nature, like the Falls provide.  The Chinese food was quite exquisite, as was the CN tower.   I would definitely recommend a trip like this one to my friends because it was such a nice place to go and see.  I think seeing the Falls and the CN tower should be on anyone's bucket list because of just how surreal the tower was, and how serene the Falls were, with that power, and sound of all of the water rushing.  The drive was a little bit rough from Kentucky, since the traffic also isn't kind once I got to Cincinnati, and then from there it just seemed to pick up more when I got up to Toledo and into Detroit.  I think it took me about 14 hours to drive up, I didn't stay at a hotel or anything, although I did take some pit stops to get food, fuel, and other various supplies.  I think I liked seeing the CN tower most, just because of how staggering it looks, right there in downtown Toronto, and also it's proximity to the rest of the city made it a very convenient place to visit while being close to the hotel and restaurants.  The Falls were a little bit far from the city, but not bad.  In closing, I'd like to say that this trip opened my eyes to what North America has to offer in general, and also what our northern neighbors have to offer also in terms of natural and man-made beauty.",memories,test,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False

He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. The next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go inpatient into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals.

Aso the first time I've ever fallen so hard while skiing. I've been skiing for over 40 years, and I was on a relatively mild slope. In fact, I was near the bottom of a relatively mild slope when I noticed a large rut in the snow that I couldn't avoid. I fell forward, and landed on my left shoulder and left side of my head. Fortunately, I was wearing a helmet, and did not suffer a concussion. I was able to make it back to my car, get out of my ski equipment, and drive myself to the emergency room. Sure enough, X-rays showed a broken left clavicle. With such a break, it is not possible to put it in a cast, so I had it in a soft sling for 3 weeks. After that, I just had to let it heal naturally, which took almost 4 months. I am a pretty active person, so it was rough getting use to not being able to do all the physical sports I enjoy.  I play pickleball 3 times a week, and I had to stop while I was healing. I also had a tough time sleeping for the first month, as it hurt every time I rolled over.

237,"I don't remember the exact date when this happened, but it was within the last couple weeks. For the past year I've been trying out various Buddhist practices - particularly a lot of different meditation techniques. Sitting meditation can cause a lot of pain to arise in the body for me, and instead of working through that like I should, I've started to do a lot of walking meditation instead. This of course leads to its own types of pain, but they're more manageable. Anyway, recently I had been doing my walking meditation as usual. I like to do an hour a day whenever I can since I work from home and can leave my computer for short times here and there. I usually break this down into 10-15 minute sessions just to make it easier to get the practice in without disturbing my work day too much. One late afternoon/early evening I was doing my walking and reached a very peaceful and tranquil state. My mind was significantly more quiet than it usually is, although there were still thoughts bubbling up here and there. I also realized at the time that the movement in my mind was starting to slow down. My mind was no longer jumping from one thought to another endlessly. This mental state continued for a few minutes as I continued to pace back and forth on my walking path and just observed it. After I finished that feeling of peace and tranquility lingered for a while before fading away. I've had some pretty strange and interesting experiences so far while exploring these different techniques. The stillness I felt during this particular session really stood out to me though.",memories,test,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

She'd suffered from a tumor that was growing larger every year. She was still a happy dog and wiggled her little stubby tail a million miles an hour whenever you'd notice her. A few months ago, she got sick and despite our best efforts, she passed away. We were able to keep her at home, she suffered from anxiety and hated to be separated from her family. We were all able to say our goodbyes and spend time with her before she passed. We buried her in our backyard, made a nice place for her to rest in peace. She brought so much love and joy into our lives and was a special dog. She was stubborn and had a weakness for chicken and just made you smile when her whole body wiggled with joy. Saying goodbye is never easy. Watching her give a last few wiggles of her tail despite being so weak but letting you know she still heard you talking to her was both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I was there as she breathed her last. I sat with her for a while hating to say goodbye and not really ever ready to let her go, but knowing that it was time. My heart still hurts when I think about her, but I also smile remembering all the wonderful memories I have of times spent with her.

Each person comes in with their own personalities, pasts, goals, strengths & weaknesses. A couple months ago someone who has worked with our house before had recommended a new guy to me. He explained to me that he was struggling in another house with other guys harassing him and making it hard for him to sleep. I took this new guy in without fully vetting him personally, because I trusted the person who was vouching for him. This turned out to be a mistake on my part, and a lesson learned. As it turned out, the problems he was having in his last sober living was related to the manic episode he was going through that our mutual friend was unaware of when he brought him to my sober living. For the next 3 weeks the entire house was on edge. He was abrasive, intense, and was always trying to do things his own way instead of following the rules. Most of these rules were little things that we give warnings about, we give people a chance to correct them, and because he didn't break any major rules I couldn't just kick him out. I COULD have, but I wouldn't feel right doing it, for something so small. As time went on it became clear to me that this was not going to change. We went to great lengths to give him a real opportunity to make it work at our house. He got on the right medication and was taking it, we were giving him plenty of 'growing room'. When it became apparent to me that this was going to be an issue, I decided I would give him advanced notice that we would not be accepting his next months fees and he should start looking for a new place to live. After hearing this, he tried to turn a new leaf - apologize to people in the house, apologize to me, but by then the damage had already been done and the people were incredibly uncomfortable living with him. A week went by and I reminded him that his time at our house was coming to an end. I made it very clear, but it was obvious to me he was not fully comprehending it, he was in deniable about the situation. On the last day I figured he would try to leave the house early to go to work and get home late, putting us in the uncomfortable position of having an argument and having to kick him out on the street in the middle of the night. I decided I would have to talk with him before he left. I heard him stirring around 3 in the morning, I told him that today was the day, he attempted a rebuttal and I reiterated that today was the day.

Resolving those issues has been a struggle for me, but while on this journey, I have felt and experienced God's amazing love and grace through it all.  I started by taking an intense Bible study that lasted ten weeks.  I have spent time in prayer, pouring my heart out to God.  I have learned that my past mistakes, hurts, and pain does not define who I am, but my life in Christ defines who I am.  While studying the Bible, I have found so many verses about God's unfailing love, His truths and promises, forgiveness, and strongholds that Satan has reminded me of for too many years.  I started writing these verses in a small notebook and when I am having a bad day, I can quickly find what I want. I have learned to forgive and let certain people know that I have forgiven them, and I have learned to ask for forgiveness for things I have done. I am on my way to freedom! Sometimes freedom it is not an instantaneous thing, but a work in progress.  To find it, I must study God's word and apply His truths to my life every day.  God's love and grace is so amazing.

I worked so hard to get my degree, struggling while working a job, taking care of two kids, my ex husband and my elderly mother in law. It was such a triumph when I got my degree. About six months ago, I lost my job due to the negligence of another nurse, and because of the belligerent new nurse manager who has had it in for me from day one.

I work, or worked rather, nights, and I am the charge nurse. This means of course that I am in charge. On the job I have my Assistant, or Nurse's Aide, and one other nurse. On slow nights, the hours drag and it can be very boring. On nights such as the full moon, it is pure chaos. The night in question happened to be a slow night, as we had only three patients and all of them were in bed asleep. During the course of the night, a fourth patient was admitted. This woman, in my informed opinion, was not so much having a mental episode, but was high on drugs. She did have some signs of mental illness. She was quiet and sweet, and just sat on the floor near our station counter, drawing artwork. On this particular night my Nurse's Aide wasn't there, and it was only me and the other nurse. I got sick during the night and had to go to the bathroom for an extended stay. The other nurse's job was to cover our station and maintain order. However while I was gone, the patient escaped.

So for our second wedding anniversary, I planned a trip to go visit the historic home. We decided to drive out to the home in Missouri because it just didn't feel right to fly. We spent the first night in a small bed and breakfast just a few miles from the Wilder home. I don't think my wife slept more than a few hours she was so excited. The next morning we hit the road very early. She wanted to spend as much time as possible exploring the home so we didn't waste any daylight. The home was everything we'd imagined and more. It felt like we were transplanted back to the late nineteenth century. There were reenactors dressed up like the Wilder family. They had all the old tools and machinery commonly seen around settler homes back then. They were doing ordinary daily chores like scrubbing clothes. We even got to see a settler churning real butter from cream. Then there were the animals. I think this was my favorite part. Seeing how the cows and other animals were kept and maintained was kind of a thrill to me. By the end of the day we were both exhausted.

I am no master artist or anything but I think this experience has given me a huge burst of inspiration. I do not think I will start creating graffiti or anything but I might start using different tools. My choice paint is watercolor because of how delicate it is and soft and beautiful the strokes come out. It takes patience because what appears when you paint, and what comes out when it dries are two different images.

I was a little worried how things were going to go because we hadn't been dating very long at the time and didn't know how we would get a long when we were in each other space all the time. We were excited to see how all this would go but first we had to get through the move. I lucky have access to a truck so we didn't  need to rent anything. My girlfriend had to work that day so i started the move solo. It wasn't to bad at first since i just did the boxes but that went by fast. Next I started with the heavier stuff with a dolly like the washer and dryer. Next was the chairs and desk but i was starting to run out of the stuff that i could move by myself. I picked my girlfriend up from work and we got a quick snack before we got back to our new place with a great view of Maine. We then started the move with the couch its not very heavy well at least for me but we had to lift it to angle it through the door. That part was very frustrating but we got through it. Next was the mattress. It was much lighter than then sofa but to angle through the halls was a mess and we started to snap at each other. I think we were both getting tired and started to take it out on one another. After we got the mattresses in though that was it and we both calmed down and turned from grumpy to relieved. Now that the move is over we have nothing but good times these last two months and i know we made the right choice to live together.,memories,test,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True

This is significant because they have been divorced for almost 40 years.  Both my stepmother and my stepfather have died in recent years, and neither had anyone to vacation with.  It was a little awkward at times, but they got along enough for us to all enjoy ourselves.  My son and husband also went with us.  We all had a great time.  We went on Segways.  Went to a local casino twice. It was awesome seeing the fireworks on the 4th of July on the beach.  The best part for all of us was the different restaurants.

I did not sleep at during the night, I tried but I could not. My girlfriend has been away for three days now, I have been calling her in vain, her phone rings and she sends me straight to voicemail. I scratched my head several times those past few days wondering what I did wrong so I could apologize but I could not place my finger on anything, I tried to assume that being Easter Holidays she must have traveled to her home town. But why did she not tell me? Anyway, I got up and showered quickly and went and picked up my friend and on the way to the hospital he could tell something was off. I decided to open up since we rarely kept anything from each other, I told him how we had spent Christmas together with my girlfriend, for the first time I did not go home to my parents home to celebrate because I wanted to spend it with her, this was also her idea, she did not have to convince me much to do it, I was in love. My friend felt disappointed, he tried to encourage me to just hang in there and everything will be work out for the greater good, this sounded like Greek to me at this point, I just wanted her back. Halfway to the hospital she called, I asked her to call me back in hour after I had checked my friend in the hospital and was free to talk. My heart was racing all the way to the hospital, anxious of what she was about to tell me, were we breaking up? where was she?. Questions and all sorts of reasoning clouded my mind and I could not wait to hear what she had to say. Finally, I was free to call back. I dialed her number and an unfamiliar male voice picked up the phone, I apologized and hang up assuming I had dialed a wrong number, I tried again and got the same voice, I tried to contain my composure and asked him if I could speak to my girlfriend, his answer ripped my heart in a million little pieces! He calmly told me ""his"" fiance was on holiday and he did not appreciate me calling her all the time. I am safely back home now. I just have to rest my head and my heart! It has been a long and stressful day and there is nothing I can do to forget about it. I just hope that tomorrow when I wake I will be level headed and start my healing and moving on journey. I do not know whether I will have the strength or the courage to fight for this love. Only time will tell, I highly doubt it though. Matters of the heart are very complex, no matter what age one is. All in all, life has to go on and I have to keep my head high, I will try however hard it is.

On the cruise, we made stops in Italy, France, and Spain.  This was a memorable vacation because it celebrated my in-laws 55th wedding anniversary.  It was great to see the whole family and be together. We all live in different parts of the country, so it is rare that we are all together at one time. We had a lot of fun with nieces and nephews who are growing up quickly. Our niece also turned 13 on the cruise, and for her birthday my husband and I took her bowling on the boat. She was so excited and happy to go with us. I will remember that moment. There were a lot of downsides to the cruise.

I made sure to choose a hotel with a swimming pool, as we both love to swim. When we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hotel also had a whirlpool! We swam most of the day and relaxed in the whirlpool for a while. We were both hungry after swimming all afternoon, so we decided to have a steak dinner. We both ordered rib eye steaks and enjoyed the meal thoroughly.  After dinner, we drove to a movie theater to see the remake of The Lion King, one of his favorite movies of all time. The theater featured a state of the art sound and visual experience called RPX. I expected a large screen and fantastic sound, but what I did not expect were the seats...overstuffed leather electric recliners that adjusted to just about every position imaginable. My husband was overjoyed at the comfort of the seats because he suffers from back pain and I felt so happy that I had chosen a theater that would allow him to see this special movie in such a memorable way. The sound was incredible, not even close to the sound experience in the movie theater we usually frequent. After the movie, my husband could not stop talking about the movie itself and the overall experience of seeing it in this type of theater. We decided at that moment that we would not wish to see a movie anywhere else, ever again.

294,"My work at my Uncle's house was grueling in the hot sun, but fulfilling as well.  While there was no one to do this work, I took it upon myself to do the weeks and weeks of hard work for no pay.   I think that doing good works for people without really asking for anything in return us honorable.  My cousin told me that he got a price quote for 1,000 dollars to do all the work.  My cousin had been sick a long time and inherited his father's house when he died.  My cousin has inherited a lot of wealth, but is in bad health himself, which is not a good thing.  In my opinion, money cannot buy mental health or sanity.  Moreover, it can be more of a burden, inheriting thousands and thousands of dollars. I spent so many weekends in the heat of the summer, doing laborious yard work over six weekends, that I lost 5 pounds. I spent my 15 minutes breaks, drinking Powerade and water during the eighth or nine hours per day that I cut down all the overgrown hedges and weeds around my Uncle's house. I also trimmed around the shed and elsewhere on my Uncle's property.  It was all work and no play at my Uncle's old house.  I did like the views in their town.  The sky was open and there were plenty of views of the mountains.  I guess that was an upside to doing the work.  You did get the fresh air of the mountains. Over the six weekends that I was tidying up the yard out front and around back, the neighbors were pleasantly surprised that work was getting done.  The one neighbor of my Uncle was on his riding tractor, cutting his lawn like everyone in my Uncle's small town tend to do.  In fact, they were watching as I took some time, cutting all the large branches and large plants that were growing near the edge of the neighbor's property.  The neighbors in town don't miss a thing.  It is a town with very little crime from the statistics that I checked out.  My Uncle's town was very safe, since everyone knows each other's name. These weeds had been overgrown for a decade, but it got the neighbor's attention -- in a good way.  The fact that things were getting done on the property and that I have a ""big heart"" and that ""God"" will ""bless me"" for doing this work was a touching moment for me.

Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications. That of course didn't need to happen, thankfully. Maybe the shock of the cold water or the mild exercise induced labor, but as soon as I stepped out of the pool I felt my first contraction. I immediately called my husband. He rushed from home where he was getting ready from work to pick me up and take me into the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital I was immediately taken to a delivery room. The doctor I had chosen for my birth was thankfully on duty at the time and was able to come in right away. He checked my cervix and announced that the baby would come soon. The next few hours that followed were a blur of pain and hard work. I opted for a natural birth with no medication, and I'm glad I did. It wasn't fun, but I got to fully experience the wonder of birth. My husband was at my side the entire time while I squeezed his hand. Finally, at 11:01am, Cameron was born. He was a beautiful baby with a thick head of black hair. He has his father's eyes, and my button nose. The nurses all said he was the most handsome baby they had ever seen. After nine months of waiting, I couldn't believe that it only took five hours for my son to arrive. We stayed overnight at the hospital so that his health could be monitored.

I figured the only direction that things could go is up from here.   How silly was I.   As the saw goes:  the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  I was so convinced volatility would trend up I employed the largest dose of leverage I could get from my broker and levered it even more with options.  And then I compounded it by betting large on Bitcoin rising.  Can you say oh for two?  All of my options contracts expired at the end of the year worthless.   If volatility  has spiked or Bitcoin had popped I would have made a killing.  It would have been the best late Christmas or New Year's gift ever.

Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people.

It sometimes pays to just to put on a poker face instead of giving into my natural instinct to just run crying to the bathroom. I did cry, but at least I managed to make it home before the damn burst. Luckily, Pete didn't notice and I just made it seem like my eyes were puffy because my allergies were acting up. I don't think it's fair to get him upset just now during his final exams, but I will tell him about it when things look brighter.  Pete maybe only 15, but he loves me very much and often takes my battles as his own. He can't always understand that, as a single mom, sometimes you just need to put up with stuff. So this past week I have just continued to do my job as usual and I have kept my head down and focused. I also tried not to rehash the moment with any of my co-workers because just reliving it gives me anxiety. I have started to look for a new job but the truth is that its a bit scary to just jump ship and I don't want to do that until the right position comes along. I need to pay the rent.

Then, he totally surprised me by asking me if I was happy.... I have not been asked that by any superior EVER in all my 30 years of work experience. And then the damn burst. I stupidly let it all out...tears, snot and all. I told him everything that David had said about me and my supposed ""lack of cooperation"" and ""selfishness"" and how he pretty much implied that I would never get a promotion if he could help it. All this screamed to me at the top of his lungs in the middle of the office. I told him that in a way I could understand how I had provoked David by refusing to change project group at this late stage of the game.

308,"About three months ago I started going to see a therapist. I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, ""that was a long time ago, get over it"". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session. That I don't need to hold onto those any longer. I can let them go. They no longer have the power to affect me.

He had been working part time for a warehouse near his house but it was closed for the season and he had been out of work for a few weeks. He had tried calling his CTE worker but he couldn't get a hold of them. He went to the bus station to get a ticket to go to where his sister lives, but the ticket was too expensive.  He had no family or friends in the immediate area, so he didn't know what to do. I had worked with him a little bit at the warehouse and he seemed like a nice enough person. I had given him a ride home from work a few times over the past few months. I gave him my phone number, so in case he needed a ride. He kept my number and gave me a call. he let me know what his situation was and that he was not sure what he should do. I told him I would drive down there to see him. When I got there he was just sitting on a bench in front of the station with his head hung low. I greeted him and he looked up at me. I asked what was going on and he said he had nowhere to go and no money so he was scared and worried that he would have to sleep out in the cold that night. I looked in my wallet and had ten dollars  in there, which I knew would get him a night at the local shelter a few miles away. I told him I could pay to get him into the shelter tonight. I told him I'd give him a ride down there so he wouldn't have to walk in the cold. He smiled and thanked me for my help. When we got to the shelter, I told him to give me a cll in the morning and I would see if I could find him some part-time work at the farm I worked on so he could try to get money for a bus ticket or somewhere more permanent to stay.

The doctor hesitated but decided to do a breathing test. This test involved walking on a treadmill while his breathing was being monitored by machines. We thought, ok, not a real big problem. In the days leading up to the testing we decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. We started cleaning our carpets but were not finished the day of the test. While doing the test the nurses were alarmed, canceled the remainder of the test and told us that my husband was NOT to do any more carpet cleaning or anything to exert himself. This caused alarms to us. We went to see the heart doctor who directed us to a heart surgeon. She immediately admitted my husband to the hospital for a quadruple heart bypass. This was a critical day for both of us, not knowing his chances of making it through the surgery or how life would be after surgery. I had to learn how to do the outdoor tasks that usually fall on the man of the house. I learned how to drive the tractor to cut the grass, and the worst of all was learning how to operate the snowblower to clear the sidewalks and driveways. I had to do all household activities for 6 months, however in the end I still had the love of my life and we continue to enjoy life together.

I am still concerned I may hurt myself or the people around me. They let me keep my belt and a multitude of other objects I could use for self-harm. Being in the inpatient care does seemingly keep me stable for the time being. The food is better than I thought it was gonna be, and the therapist is a little better trained for the situation than I thought she was going to be as well. However I am confused as to why I was prescribed medication before I was properly diagnosed with a mental health ailment. I do appear to be self aware and mentally stable enough to communicate my problems. I am not a trained for the situation like they are so I'm trying not to stress out about it. There are only a few channels available on the TV, and it's driving me crazy.  The commercials playing are largely about mental health issues and being compensated for a lawsuit.

I had told my partner she was coming to a city about an hour away from us, but that I didn't have the money for tickets and that I was gutted that I would miss it.  It was surely going to a memorable tour experience, as she was playing solo in small, intimate venues which is unusual. The day the tickets were released my partner grabbed some before they sold out, took me to dinner that night, and told me there. I was so happy I cried in the restaurant! Anyway, the day of the show my partner was gracious enough to drive over to the venue two hours before the doors opened so we would be sure to get a good seat. We waited in the cold, I was so excited time flew by. The venue was a gorgeous old church, with the audience sitting in pews. We got some drinks and sat around for an hour, and then the lights dimmed. I almost couldn't contain myself, I felt as though I was going to burst. The artist came on, and immediately launched into my very favorite song! Which she never plays live! I was stunned, and immediately began crying. The rest of the show was equally as beautiful and touching. Her voice was transcendent, soaring into the eaves of the church. The experience was absolutely indescribable.

But I understand that she would not have wanted a big funeral even though I think the family could afford it.   It was outside on a nice day too.

You never get to even comprehend the people that were close to your grandparents, their parents, their siblings, their friends, and to see some of those people pop up was great. I wish I had more time to talk to them.   I almost gathered the courage to say something. I'm not sure why I did not, a few people wanted me to, but I felt like what was said was enough. I know the relationship I had with her may have seemed distant to others but I knew it was closer than that. I think what I remember the most about the funeral is that there wasn't much crying. My dad didn't cry. My Mom mentioned that too, she wanted to hold back her tears because there wasn't many being shed.

My wife had a hard time saying no as well, so it wasn't just me. Apparently they were all going to the state fair, and wanted us to go along. They made their cases about how we never see each other, and we agreed it had been quite some time since we had done something together. I kept double checking on the sly with my wife to make sure she was okay with it. Thankfully, she was. The fair turned out to be a lot of fun, and we all had a lovely time. We rode some rides, my wife won me a prize, which was funny. Afterwards, we decided to go to a local pub and have a few drinks. I just had a beer, and my wife had some wine.

I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, numchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe.  Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported,  as an individual,  as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.  When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded.

The separation I felt was immense. I had seen my friends go on these rides and come out unharmed and very satisfied, what was I afraid of? My closest friend gave me the nudge I needed. She said, ""Its fun because you're not in control."" I couldnt wrap my head around that but it made me curious. That is how my love for roller coasters began.

Sometimes it's for specific get togethers and sometimes just to hang out for a bit, to grab a beer, watch sports on TV, etc. Among my circle of friends it's a regular meeting place for us so this BBQ was nothing out of the ordinary.

I wasn't more than a few blocks from his house on that Sunday afternoon and my car got T-boned. Another car came out of a driveway into a main road from my right side and plowed into me as I was driving under the speed limit at around 40 MPH. My car spun around in traffic due to the impact and by the time I got my bearings I found myself looking at an exploded air-bag, a crumpled front end and my engine steaming smoke. I was disoriented and sore and it took me some time to realize what happened. I ended up with a broken arm and a concussion from the impact. For the first time in my life I had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.

Since the other driver wasn't insured, it wasn't surprising to me that I wasn't able to go after them for additional damages since they basically had no money or assets themselves.

This is such a big step as a parent, having your first move out to an apartment.  It seems so much more important and different than when she moved to the dorm.  The dorm was strictly for two semesters whereas the apartment is a year long lease that ends after her next school year starts.  This is the beginning of her being even more grown up and on her own.  She will most likely never live with us full time ever again.  The moment is filled with pride, seeing how she has grown and going after her dream.  She is an amazing person.  Empathetic, loyal, a great example to her younger siblings, still painfully shy, yet emerging as this fiercely independent young woman who is willing to step out of her comfort zone to overcome the obstacles she encounters, one who knows she has value and a right to be seen as equal.  Last school year her younger sister attended the same college.  They lived in separate wings of the same dorm.  I liked the comfort of knowing she had her best friend available at all times.

My mom had recommended to me Tae Kwon Do so that's what I did. I fell in love with it right away and moved up the ranks. While other kids were at school practicing football and baseball I would be at the Dojo learning all I could. Fast forward about a month ago it was finally time for me to go for my red belt. Practice had become my life because achieving this belt meant everything to me. I went through my entire repertoire while filming myself. I wanted to see where I could improve. I took not and practiced what I needed.  At that point I felt that I had the discipline and skill necessary to achieve the rank. In the weeks leading up to this I continued to practice night and day. I felt muscles in my body that I didn't even know existed, but it all paid off in the end. When I receive my red belt it felt like a crowning achievement.

Being aware of the fear and panic that can cause bystanders from stepping in and helping during a crisis, we decided to get out to see if we could help save the driver. We are not sure if the person that came up to us for help was with the driver when the accident happened, but apparently she was a friend of the driver. She was noticeably panicking and losing control. Based on experience during a emergency, I knew the best thing for her to do was to be calm and rational. I tried to ease her nerves and offer her reassurance. She was grateful and wanted to contact us later. That ended up not happening as there wasn't anything in return that we were in need of.

My oldest son began to panic, but I hugged him and kept talking to him calmly. We waited until the all-clear signal was given and then went to the party.

They told me that they we also planning on going to bike.  Small talk, said hope to see them there and I continued my ride around the lake.Next morning, day of the ride, the woman I was supposed to go on the date with the previous evening text me ""Hey, are you mad at me? Call me"". Conversation ensued as to what my plans were for the night.  She then asked ""are you mad at me?""

I wanted us to do something special for her 40th birthday, so I took her to Universal Studios Orlando so we could visit The Wizarding World of Harry Potter! It was the first time we had been on vacation with just the two of us.  We had so much fun!  We stayed out late every night, and racked up over 30,000 steps on our last day in the parks!  Needless to say, we were exhausted at the end of the day, but it was worth it!  We got to ride all the rides we wanted, got to try three different kinds of butterbeer, and got to have ice cream from Florean Fortescue's.  Our favorite ride was the one that goes through the Hogwarts castle. It was like being right there in the movies!  Another good one was the ride that went through Gringotts Bank.  It was funny to watch the people jump when the dragon on top blew his fireball.  We made sure to eat at both The Leaky Cauldron and The Three Broomsticks.  Both had really good food, especially for a theme park.  While we were there, we heard that they're going to open a new ride that's based on Hagrid's motorcycle We will have to make a return trip to ride that one once the hype has died down.  Another of our favorite spots was the Dr. Seuss world.  It was fun to see all the characters, and they seemed to have some of the best shirts and merchandise. A really cool restaurant was the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium.  It's decorated in 19th century steampunk decor, and was really unusual.  Their ices cream sundaes averaged $15 each, but they were well worth it.  The one I got had a whole piece of red velvet cake on top of it!  We made sure to take lots of pictures to remember the trip.

I thought I'd had experiences with losing sleep before, but nothing has ever compared to this. Even being healthy, early birth aside, I couldn't help but feel something could and would go wrong at any moment. I was constantly on edge, thinking some nurse would come in to tell me he'd taken a turn for the worse.

Although I'm sure I acted more than a little nuts to them, they managed to put up with me regardless. I don't know if I've ever had a moment of pure relief more powerful when the doctors told me he was ready to come home, and was doing fine.

388,On May 18th of 2019 my grandmother unexpectedly passed away. She passed away during the night. She passed away in her sleep. The official cause of death was listed as a major heart attack. My grandmother and father both lived in my own at the time this happened. Both my father and grandmother were disabled and I am their primary caregiver. This event was very traumatic to my family. My grandmother was a very influential and important part of our family. My grandmother was the matriarch of the family. The day that it happened my father knocked on my door in the morning and woke me and told me that my grandmother was gone. I immediately jumped out of bed. The paramedics has just taken her in an ambulance to the hospital while trying to resuscitate her. My father was totally devastated by this event. He was hurt and emotional and crying over the passing of his mother. I tried to do my best to console him while also handling all of the funeral expenses and requirements. We had to call and notify all of our other family members about her passing away as well. It was a very difficult and emotional experience for our family. Funerals are very expensive and there is not a lot of financial help available to people out there. I now urge everyone I know to have life insurance and a will to help simplify this process and reduce stress on the family members.,memories,test,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

390,"So I don't go out much. I'm pretty comfortable being a homebody and just hanging out with my cats. A couple of years ago me and my now-husband moved from our home state and away from my family, who I miss every day. Every year my mom will come down to visit in the spring time. This year she came the weekend after my birthday in April with her fiance so that we could have a mini-celebration. I had told her that I've been wanting to do an Escape Room for a while now, and she found one in my area so that we could all go do it together. I was really excited because I LIVE for puzzles. The Escape Room was very confusing at first - as I'd never ever done one before - but once I got the hang of the process it was so much fun. My team consisted of me, my husband, my mom, her fiance, and four teenage strangers. We ended up racing the clock to the very last minute, literally. We were holding the book with the code to escape the room when time ran out! Surprisingly, the most memorable part of the event was the aftermath. My husband told me he loved seeing me that way. I asked what way? And he told me how my leadership skills and ability to put together seemingly insignificant details was something he didn't get to see in me all that often. And that's true, as a homebody I don't do a whole lot with friends. I don't play too many games. I don't really have a job where I can apply those abilities in my day to day. It was a definite reminder that I am a capable person when given the opportunities to apply myself. All in all, I had so much fun and I really hope to do it again sometime soon.",memories,test,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True
391,"I was on vacation with my partner and their partner. We're poly, and that's important to me. We went out to a really nice cafe together, known for having good vegan options in town. It was a really stressful thing, trying to find places that would actively cater to my friend/my partner's partner. But, we found this place, and set out to go together. They were vastly understaffed, but the food was good and it was a quiet, gentle atmosphere. We took pictures together before we ate, and the meal was really nice to share. My partner sat between us, and we were all on a booth seat. We had a nice conversation and enjoyed the food. After that, we went out on a walk together throughout the town. It was a really nice experience, being able to be publicly affectionate without the worry of judgement. No one around here really knew us, we're just visitors. It's not like it'd have a lasting effect on us if they wanted to be upset with us for being visibly queer and non-monogamous. The feeling of safety and warmth of getting to spend time with my family, walking around, admiring the sunset and enjoying our meal together was wonderful. I will remember this day for a very long time. We had to go home that next day, but that night was one of the most memorable, holding hands freely in public, taking pictures, even being able to kiss in public. It was a nice feeling, that we rarely got to have, one that was set in a stunning backdrop of a quiet downtown and a cute vegan-friendly cafe.

392,"It was a normal day in the middle of the week when I decided to go to Santander Bank to withdraw some cash and then go to Wegman's. I was intending to go get some food, but it was also the only opportunity I had to smoke marijuana outside of the house. This is because I couldn't do it while my dad was home. So I went in my brother's car and drove through a small route I normally go for discretion. On the way I put small amount of cannabis in my pipe and smoked a little while driving. At that point I decided I should drive around and listen to music, then I should go to the bank. I took a long route around, and noticed at some point a cop car ended up behind me. I was nervous, thinking they might have known what I did. While I was nearing the bank, the cop car was still behind me, and eventually started flashing its lights. I thought I was surely done for, and as the two cops walked up after I had parked in a Barnes & Noble parking lot I thought I might have a panic attack. To my surprise, I was acting calm enough as they stated the reason they pulled me over is because the car was unregistered for a couple months. I didn't have up-to-date documentation and had to call my dad to get me a picture of proof of insurance, but it was surely better than them noticing any wrongdoing. Throughout the ordeal they didn't suspect anything, as I had hidden away anything suspicious and there was no smell. I was very lucky that day, especially considering I had illegal narcotics within reach in the car. I believe this will be the last time I do something so suspect on the road. At the very least, it will be the last time I smoke weed on the road.",memories,test,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True,True

We were so excited to go. The trip was to celebrate different birthdays. we had two connecting flights that we had to catch. The first leg was awesome. As we got on to board the second leg we removed from the plane because the flight attendant said my husband had an extra carry on. He was carrying the bag for an elderly member of our family and he tried to explain that but they didn't care. We had to get off the plane and take a later flight.  It put a horrible taste in out mouth for the beginning of our trip. We put so much money into this trip that it really made me so angry with the airlines. We missed scheduled activities because of the delay. The part that stuck with me was how we were treated by the airline. It will probably be our last rip for awhile simply because of how we were treated.,memories,test,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True
394,"Being talked down to by my older colleagues has been a constant theme in my career.   It's always seems to be the same scenario - they think I'm over confident.  About two months ago, I was given a peach assignment as a lead on a project.  I was so excited and energized while my colleagues were kind of resistent and downplayed the importance of the project.  They told me I was too optimistic because in the end the project would fail like all the other projects regardless of effort.  They told me it would be a big fall if I didn't come down from the clouds.  Instead of listening to them I started looking at the psychology behind their attitudes of impending failure.  I realized that they were missing the ""what's in it for me"" concept.  They saw no benefit for them to a lot of effort and hard work.  I saw this as a challenge.  How do I make them see their effort as a win?  How can I quantify and qualify the outcomes of their efforts.  I decided to make sure every project task completion had an outcome of reward both tangible and intangible.  I showed them how the effort and work they are doing benefits their customer, and themselves.  The reward of  successful completion leads to provable skill and knowledge.  I found the sweet spots of their sense of accomplishment and motivations and used it to garner their buy-in and support.  With everyone on the same page moving us toward success my colleagues were genuinely more helpful and excited to help me as a project lead.  In two months time the whole attitude of our team has changed.  They no longer see me as the young pup.  They h ave accepted me as a leader even though most of them are 20 years older than me.  I don't feel anxious and eager to please.  I have found their motiviations and I have earnestly tried to encourage and care for their successes as well as my own.  Last week I was able to provide a recommendation for a team member who intially had resisted the project because of her 180 degree turn around. Because of her changes in attitude she became a focal team member and will be leading her own project team soon.",memories,test,False,True,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,False
395,"Certain levels of stress at work can even be beneficial, since they stimulate us and give us the batteries. However, having too many responsibilities, giving account to your boss or a bad relationship with colleagues can lead to severe stress that must be nipped in the bud, either taking a while, or looking for another job destination. There is even the Burnout syndrome, which is characterized by a progressive physical and mental exhaustion, a lack of absolute motivation for the tasks performed, and especially by important changes in behavior in those who suffer it. There are great sources of stress from the family: we may live with a loved one who is not in the best physical or mental condition and we have to take care of him, traumatic events such as the loss of a family member, economic problems at home, with our couple or even if we have children, who behave in an undesired way. The best we can do in these cases is, if it is a serious problem, seek psychological or psychiatric help. Although not all sentimental ruptures are the same for everyone, the vast majority causes great stress and regret. Thinking if the other person has remade his life, stagnate, not be able to reorient our goals, stay locked up at home ... there are certain cases in which psychological help is also required to overcome this type of trauma. A change, a change of city, the own emotional break and therefore ending with all those daily and routine activities that made us feel protected can be important sources of stress. Getting married or having children also causes some anxiety about the future, since we can have negative thoughts about a new stage in our life. There is only one place where you can live and enjoy, and it is this present moment, the one you have here and now, if you let your mind go to the past or future, you will stress and it will be an unreal stress, because you create yourself with your thoughts. Whether in our circle of friends or in our own work, we can suffer from so-called ""toxic people"". The ideal for a bad environment does not cause us stress, would be to spend as little time as possible with this type of people. But as often it is not possible, because it can be a family, or at work where we have to spend so many hours, it would be good if the little free time we had would be fully enjoyed, in order to balance the balance of negativity that we have had to be exposed. To be well with others, first you have to be well with yourself to be alone. In the age of social networks, many young people feel alone or are too aware of mobile phone notifications, which can cause a high amount of stress. It is increasingly common to reduce the actual contact, by contact with the computer and other electronic devices. Years ago, people related more time face to face.",memories,test,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

I am good friends with him and his new wife whom I have known since college. He had a small wedding with only close family and friends. It was quite a thing to watch after them being together for so long and finally getting married. I was the best man and had a small role in the wedding. IT was not that traditional with both of them being older. They had a reception and some of our other buddies cooked up a bunch of brisket on the smoker. It was good and everyone had a nice time. We did a few of the traditions that we have come up with as a group since college when anyone gets married. We all were glad to see him married but did not think he would ever commit to it after all this time. He was never big on commitments.

399,"An event that was memorable for me within the last 3 months or so was taking a licensing exam for my profession. The test was a multi-day event and had very tight security. It was nerve-wracking studying the day of the exam for the test and in addition getting through security for the exam was annoying. After I got through security I had to wait in a huge room with several hundred other test takers for the exam to start. The proctors read pages and pages of instructions for the exam which was very nerve-wracking as I didn't want to make a simple mistake that could mess up my score on the exam before I even started. Eventually, after what seemed like forever, the exam finally started. The questions were incredibly complicated but I kept going and kept trying my hardest on the exam.  The exam went for several sessions over two days. So before each session I had to listen to many of the same security instructions before each part of the exam. But it slowly got less nerve-wracking as I got used to the exam instructions. During each session though the questions were still incredibly hard. But at the end of each session I was happy because I felt like I had completed another big part of the exam. After the last session of the exam I felt so happy. I actually finished the last session a little early and was able to get out of the exam before a massive crush of everyone else finishing up the exam.

It took me about a week to construct everything that was needed , built an outside couch with scrap wood and a movie screen , so the projector collecting dust could finally have purpose. Nonetheless , after working tirelessly to construct everything it all came together with some hard work. The L shaped couch was built , with two air mattresses , solar lights where put up so they could see, projector was set up , tent was put up so she could have a sleep over in the same area. Nonetheless , the say had finally arrived when all my hardwood would pay off. My daughter turned the corner to see all i had done for her , and she immediately began to cry! Tears of joy of course, but she couldn't believe what i had don and how much it looked so wonderful. Later that day her friends arrived and were also astonished. I had popcorn , full size candy bars, pizza, and cooler full of sodas. They had a blast, and i could hear her friends saying how cool i was and couldn't believe your mom did this. It made me feel wonderful that all my hard-work paid off. But the best part was that my daughter will never forget her 14th birthday. Ever child should have memorable moments like this during there childhood and im just so happy i was able to pull it off.

I know she will always be there to support those around her with unconditional love. I have always been more of a cat person but admittedly have never had a dog in my life really. I now understand why people love dogs so much. My sister recently lost her much beloved dog. This was after an average lifespan but with several health complications. This inspired me to adopt a puppy of my own. I am so thankful that I did. Dogs are a real game changer when it comes to enjoying life to it's fullest. I still really appreciate my cat but I have newfound perspective on dogs. Animals are such a gift to this planet. I wish people would realize this truth everywhere.,memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

It was a busy and emotional time for all of us.  As we left it was surprising to see my son being emotional and not wanting to let go of his hug. I was very touched by this and tried not to cry.  Our daughter on the other hand was off and running and could'nt get rid of us fast enough. I returned to a quiet house with the dogs wondering where everyone had gone.  It was now just me and my husband.  We will now be able to do what we want to do for dinner and sit where we want to watch what we want on the big screen TV.  I am not so sure I like it.

I first discovered the animal abuse by my wife when I started playing back videos she had sent me early-on in our relationship and additional videos she had sent me in the Summer of 2017 through June of 2018. The reason these where sent to me was for the intention of sensual and sexual and romantic purposes. I soon realized that not only was she engaging in animal abuse, but she had also gone to great lengths to conceal (cover up) images from what she was watching as she was filming herself for me. Oddly enough, they were not for me as she had actually filmed these all before we met or early-on in our relationship. She sent them to me as though they were current and in response to missing me or in response to a video I sent her. When we first met, she was living in Cyprus and around a year after first meeting on-line, I was in Cyprus living with her. The intention was for u to marry and live our days out together. The problem with that, is that she didn't follow through and after 9 months I returned to Oregon. That is when she sent most of the videos. It would be another 13 months before I saw her again. When I did see her after 13 months, she came here to Oregon and we married. She returned to Cyprus and I was to come within 3-4 months. Needless to say, I am sitting in Oregon typing this and I have not returned to Cyprus.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
105,"Honestly, one of the most memorable events in my life recently was the day of my wedding. This was nearly 4 months ago, and is still pretty fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good day, which started bright and early at 7 am for me and my friends. I had to get to the hair salon at 8am to get ready for hair and makeup. My friends were all tired, and I was as well. Mostly because I was super anxious and ready to get married finally. But it all went smoothly, and we were done in about 3 hours. We still had time to kill, so we went to grab lunch nearby. Then shortly after that we got ready to head to the church to finish getting ready for the wedding. Now that part was chaotic. My dad lost or misplaced parts of his suit rental. And, my dress which had fit previously the week before, was not closing up properly. Go figure, I ended up having to be sewed into my dress. Then it came time to get married finally. And all of the stress and anxiety went away the moment I saw my husband finally. It went very smoothly, even though our friend dropped our wedding rings. We said our vows and all that. And then after the ceremony was over we headed to the after party. There are alot of cherished memories that come along with that day. And, I'll never forget it.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
106,"I have stayed up many nights trying to finish this proposal and keep hitting road blocks.  Every time I seem to feel I had gotten ahead on this project it seems I fell two steps back.  Analyzing the data and inputting it was a lot harder than I originally thought, which then made that part take longer.  I worried I wouldn't finish on-time but I knew I would.  I always have.  I worked tirelessly for my family and tried to make sense of this task.  Mark, my partner at the firm was tasked with a different project section.  He'd been kind enough to help me these last 3 weeks in analyzing the data and finding the best way to project all of our ideas.  I had so many ideas floating in my head, but finally pin pointed the one that makes the most sense yet.  This company needs to grow and to do that we need an excellent strategy and proposal to get this client to trust us. When the day came to present to presentation everything fell into place.  The clients seemed genuinely happy with my proposals and our ideas.  Here we are 3 weeks later and the call comes.  We didn't land the client.  No reason, just went with a better proposal.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,
107,"One time, about five months ago, I got severely injured at work. I was working at a hospital on the west coast‚Äîspecifically, on the psychiatric unit. I had been assigned to a schizophrenic patient who had displayed severe aggression in his last admission. I had remembered this specifically from his last admission, and I thought I would be more prepared to handle him. Boy, was I wrong. In a matter of seconds after introducing myself, he jumped from his seat and grabbed my left arm. My shoulder dislocated nearly immediately, rendering me completely defenseless. Thankfully, he threw no punches at me, but he held onto my arms as I called for help. Eventually a nurse was able to push him back, and in that adrenaline rush I grabbed him with my good arm to take him to seclusion with the nurse. Somehow, with my dislocated arm, we were able to escort him to the seclusion room for unit safety. It is one of the craziest things I had ever experienced, and to this day I still have nightmares about it. Today, I still do not have 100% range of motion in my shoulder or arm, and I think that will be the case forever. It was a very bad thing to happen to me, and I am fortunate it did not get any worse. It is a crazy thing to remember as I write this and it still affects me emotionally. Fortunately, I have been able to use some mindfulness meditation to get it off my mind whenever the memory creeps up on me.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
108,"Today I am going to share something that I never wanted to think again in my life. However, after reading the requirement that was the first thing came in my mind. This happened almost three months ago while I was away from home. I loved my grandfather so much. I was so close to him. He used to tell me a lot of old stories about him and I used to enjoy them a lot. We always had so much fun together. So I had to go out of state for some work related issues for about two weeks or so. In that time my grandfather was really fit and had no health issues whatsoever. However, after few days I got a call from my mom that the grandfather just had a heart attack and he is in ICU now. I had no words to say. I got so panic and did not know what to do. I went straight to the airport and found out the flight just left and the next flight was in about 3-4 hours. I had no choice but to wait for the flight. Those three to four hours for me were like three to four years that day. I just wanted to go to the hospital and see him. Anyway finally, after waiting for couple hours I took the flight and went straight to the hospital. When I reached there I saw that everyone crying and hugging each other. I asked my mom what happened, where is grandpa? Is he okay? She said ‚Äúhe is no more, he left us‚Äù. When I heard this I felt like I lost my best friend. A friend that I used to share everything of my life. That was a big loss of my life. I still miss him a lot in so many cases and still cry remembering his stories.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
109,"The first decent car I ever bought was a 2013 Nissan Maxima.  I got it after the $1000 clunker I bought in high school died on me.  Having a mechanic glance at it would have cost more than it was worth. I went around looking for a newish used car, but I had bad credit from some delinquent bills from college.  Most places wouldn't finance a car without a HUGE down payment.  I was just out of college and had no money and only an entry-level job.  Billy Bob's Used Cars said that they would finance anyone.  The cars in Billy Bobs had the monthly payments stickered onto their windshields.  The prices were less than I'd seen elsewhere.  I was really stressed out about the whole situation.  I was stupid and I rushed through the whole process and didn't carefully read the sales contract.  In the fine print was a little mention of this thing called a ""balloon payment.""  At the end of the loan, i was expected to pay a lump sum of $1200.  That was why the payments were so reasonable. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and the state Department of Consumer Affairs, but they both said that, while rare, car financing with a balloon payment was legal.  Just because the dealership failed to mention the final payment verbally doesn't mean that there's anything actionable in the agreement because there it was in writing.  I think the dealer and other dealers take advantage of the fact that some people just want to get the odious process over and done with as quickly as possible.  It is just an embarrassing episode that I don't like to talk about. I have better credit now, so my bank kindly gave me a loan on the equity of my now 6 year old car.  I really should have more closely read the sales agreement to begin with.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,
110,"Approximately 6 months ago we made the decision to sell our home and build another one with all of the things we wanted. I had recently gotten a significant promotion at work and we knew that with the economy being the way it was, it was as good a time as ever to make this move. Whenever we talked about our wishes for our future home, we always knew we wanted a view. There was some land being prepared for some new houses to be built on in our current neighborhood. The way it was set up, we knew that there would never be the ability to have new construction block the view of the lot we wanted to purchase, meaning we would always have the view we wanted. With the market being the way it is, our house sold quickly and we needed to move into temporary residence until the new home construction was completed. We chose to rent a duplex in our current neighborhood so that the kids school would not be affected. This was going to be an exciting adventure for them! We had secured all the loans and funding in addition to the money from the sale of our house to purchase the new home and were all set to get going on the build. There ended up being a very bad weather pattern that settled in our area for weeks. The land we wanted was on a pretty steep hill and as it turns out the water run off washed away a good part of the hill during this unusual weather pattern. We backed out of the deal and decided to keep looking for a different location to build. I had gone to work the next week and as it turns out my new position at work was offering me an opportunity to relocate with better pay! The new job was located in California, just 20 minutes away from Disneyland! We talked it over as a family and ultimately made the decision to start this new adventure over in a whole new place! We were all so excited!",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,
111,"For 7 months we'd been saving for a family vacation. The first family vacation we'd taken as a family of four (plus the in-laws).  We'd invited my in-laws to join us an extra set of eyes to help keep an eye on the girls while we went to the beach (you never know when one of them is going to want to run off and we didn't want anyone alone in or near the water). Not only was this our first family vacation as a family of four, but it was to the beach. The girls had never been to the beach before.

I was so surprised at everything we did. The groom's brother, was the best man and he planned everything. We started the night out with a nice poker game. We played for about an 2 hours. Great game of friends and the groom ended up winning the most which is great since he is the groom. After we finished our game we went to a loyal strip club for some fun and dinner. The show was great lots of beautiful women. The owner who was a friend of Jack's even had the lady's do a special show just for us to celebrate groom's last day of being a bachelor. Great music and great dancing I will never forget. When we were done we went back to groom's brother, and sleep for a couple hours. We had a 7am fight to go see the Cowboys play. I am not a fan, but Alex loves them and this was his day or should I say days.  We showed up at the station a couple hours early. We were all a little confused why and then to our surprise the manager of the Cowboys comes out and leads us to the field. Another friend there works for the owner in one of his other businesses and got us in to meet the whole team.  These was the best bachelor party I have ever been too. And I am glad groom had the time of his life. We flew back to town the next day and groom was married a day later. I wish him all the luck and happiest in his marriage.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,
113,"I'll never forget that day in April last year.  How could I?  Even though I was born 27 years ago I was really born on that day.  All of my childhood and young adult years feel like such a blur now.  Such a waste.  Not that I didn't have fun experiences and all.  I did.  I have had many and many good friends and times out of fun.  But through all of those years, I had never known truly what I was here for.  For Jehovah.  I never even knew his name, can you believe it?  The creator of the universe and all that we see about us, and I never once stopped to think of him.  Now, he is all I think about.  My daily scripture readings have opened my eyes for the first time in my life.  I now see the meaning behind everything people do and my life has become more fulfilling where once it was empty.  How could I have been so blind before?  No matter, scripture teaches us to look forward and become better, not dwell in the past.  And so I do that, every day, rising to meet Jehovah and thinking of him when I go to bed.  My life is full now.  I can die happy.  For I have Jehovah in my corner.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,
114,"I thought that leaving the Army would be a good thing, but initially it was nothing but a struggle.  A struggle that made me stronger in the long run.  When I graduated from high school, I had no idea what to do with my life.  I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.  I ended up sleeping on the couches of friends and eventually, they got tired of me.  I got another greasy spoon job, but it didn't pay enough to afford rent, especially deposit and utilities.  I could have stayed at a cheap motel, but I figured I was better in the streets.  After being robbed a few times, and run off by cops, I decided to swallow my pride and go to a shelter.  The local city mission took me in, fed me a few times a day, and helped me find a better job.  Even though on the surface I was better, I was struggling with depression from my experiences and had a breakdown.  The shelter helped me to get some mental health treatment, and in six months I was ready to move into a small efficiency apartment.  I didn't have furniture, and I slept on a air mattress but it was mine and I could afford it.  In a few years, I had learned a trade, saved some money,  and moved to Florida a few months ago.  I have a good paying job, a much nicer apartment in a good neighborhood.  Things are looking up for me.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,

Earlier this year he was involved in a car accident after his junior prom. Why do people drink and drive? I should be getting my drivers permit pretty soon but my parents aren't exactly thrilled for me to be driving soon. I can understand, it has been a traumatizing experience for me as well. But I know they could use the help with running errands and taking my little sister to school. My brother was always so helpful, he was like superman. Captain of the basketball team, on the honor roll, popular and still made time to help us with homework and getting where we needed to be when mom and dad were working long hours. Ever since he died things have been quiet at home. We try not to being him up much and when we do, we smile and then immediately get saddened that we can't hear just one more joke. He and a few friends had been involved in an accident with a drunk driver who is now in prison, this wasn't his first DUI but we are praying it is his last. I hope they put him away for a long time. My brother's life wasn't the only one that was lost that night. Two other individuals from his basketball team were in the car with him, twins to a single mom who lives just down the street. I see her from time to time when I ride my bike around the neighborhood. She looks sad, lonely. I know just the feeling. My brother was the only one who didn't make me feel invisible.

I knew that I wanted to got somewhere with a lot of sun shine and beach views. so, naturally, my top two options were Florida or Hawaii. I found a good deal on a Hawaiian package after searching for vacation packages online. I was looking at a 5 days, 4 night on the sunny beached of Hawaiian. I was excited and eager to start my relaxation. Little did I know that this vacation did the exact opposite for me. When I arrived at the hotel, I was amazed at the tropical scene, the cool, blue skies, and the active beaches. After getting situation in my hotel room, I ate some breakfast. It was then that I first noticed it in the hotel's restaurant. There doesn't seem to be a lot singles here. All I see are couples or hotel workers. I look around the restaurant, and It seems like I am the only single guy here. I got self-conscious real quick after that. I tried to forget about this by eating my breakfast and to head to the beach. Once at the beach, the scene got worse for me. I laid on a beach chair and saw couple after couple smiling and enjoying themselves. Seeing them just made me realize how alone I am. My desire to form a connection with another person was raging within me. I couldn't enjoy the rest of my vacation after that.

It's been a month, and I've finally accepted it - I'm done. I should probably just block her number and block on her Facebook, maybe that will prove to her that I'm really not interested. Tonight I ran in to Cindy while Brad and I were out getting a drink after work. I've already been avoiding all of her texts and messages, but then she saw me and couldn't help herself I guess. She came over and told me, in front of Brad (she's apparently getting more comfortable embarrassing people in front of friends), that I had hurt her feelings.

The state we are going to make things happen is in California. So we just packed our things and said good bye and hello to California. I know this is a cut throat environment. It can be a little competitive at time but for the most part its something I am used to. We told family and they were shcked. They thought that we would come back never looking the same.

At the time, we had lived apart for over 3 years, but he remained obsessed with me. I was with my boyfriend that night, and in the morning stopped at my friend's house before going home.  My friend's garage was opened about 2 feet, and I was sitting in the garage waiting for her to get back from picking our friend up at the Amtrak station.  I was looking down at my phone when suddenly my ex was on the ground, on his stomach, sliding under the garage door.  He grabbed me and asked where i had been all night, and started pleading and begging me to tell him.  I didn't tell him where I was or who  I was with because it was nine of his business.  He then switched gears completely, and suddenly got very angry.  He was still holding me by my upper arms, when he slammed me down on the ground on top of something piled up in the garage.  Whatever it was he slammed me down on, had a peg sticking out of it, and it felt like it went straight through me, straight through my organs.  My first thought was a couple more blows like that and I would be dead.  As I got up I realized I suddenly couldn't breathe very well, and I said ""You really hurt me.""  He didn't seem to hear me though, and so I sat down on the chair to catch my breath.  He was still angry and he hit me in the face, afterwards saying, ""please dont call the police.""  I told him I wouldn't call the police if he would just please leave, then he saw me holding my cell phone and a struggle followed.  He started trying to grab my phone from my hands and I resisted.  We struggled for some time with it until it dropped on the floor and i kicked it under the motorcycle.  My attempts to keep him from my phone failed tho, and he reached across and grabbed my phone.  I told him I couldn't breathe and he told me I was breathing just fine. He took my phone and took off.  It was the reason why he came in the first place.  He was dying to know, where I had been that night and who I was with.Luckily, my friends came back moments later and drove me to the emergency room.  I suffered 2 broken ribs and a collapsed lung from the incident, not to mention my Iphone that he stole.Now, my ex has a pending court case.

I was so thrilled and relieved to be leaving town and having a getaway! After a four hour drive we arrived. We went grocery shopping our first night so we could cook to save some money while down there. During our stay we went shopping for clothes, rode on a speedboat, ate several restaurants, rode on a skywheel, and just relaxed while looking at the ocean.

The kids were in the back yard playing ball, some were exploring the wooded area, others were on the swing set. It was almost like a school playground there were so many of them. One little girl exclaimed look a family of deer. All the kids stopped to look at the mommy deer and her 3 fawns, so majestic. The screeching of the kids drove the deer away and it was back to playing. The adults were enjoys the food and the drinks were flowing freely. Lots of beer, wine and liquor. My niece made a pitcher of mojitos and a pitcher of margaritas. At this point everybody was feeling pretty good. My brother in law had drank a few to many and then the yelling started. ""MAGA"" was yelled out by him at my nieces husband from Mexico ""build the wall"", ""go back where you came from"". Now some of the other men stepped in as hands were going to be thrown.

I haven't had a lot of salt in the past few weeks so it was intense salt taste. I wanted to give him something really special and personal for Christmas (I believe it was our second or third Christmas together). I reflected back on gifts that my loved ones had given me through the years and decided that my absolute favorite gift was the photo album of my life that my parents put together for me. Given that my husband's parents had died several years before we met, I thought it would be the perfect way for me to get to know him and a beautiful memento of his life that he would cherish forever. I spent hours after work secretly rifling through a box of photos I found, gathering the best shots of him, his family, his homes and his beloved dogs. I hoped he wouldn't see any part of my project before it was over since I wanted him to be totally surprised. I took pride and delight in my project.

With public school out of the question (poor quality and too much liberal propaganda, thank you very much), I had to homeschool. Now, having to homeschool was something I dreaded even before my children were born. I hate teaching. I think everyone should do their job, the one they trained for.  Well, I never trained for teaching, and let's say I'm not a natural. Anyway, somehow I'd made it through the year. I learned to enjoy some parts of it, and my children made progress, but for the most part, I still hated it, and I'm afraid it showed. So when the year was over, I sat there and wondered what I was going to do next school year. I couldn't imagine homeschooling AGAIN, yet there seemed to be no other options. I checked other Christian and private schools in the area - way too expensive. I kept thinking about it, same thoughts circling in my mind. I went to get mail - and there was a letter from my kids' old school in the mailbox! At first, I thought maybe it was about some old bill I forgot to pay. I opened it... and I couldn't believe my eyes! It said the school was re-opening! With slightly lowered rates, too!! How do I describe this terrible weight instantly lifting off my shoulders?

I guess we all think this way though until it happens to us. The thing that hurts the most though is not just the fact that he has committed adultery but the length of time that its been going on. I guess looking back I should have known but I never questioned his late nights. I never questioned those weekends away. I trusted him wholeheartedly. I think now I just feel so foolish. Did he ever laugh at me knowing what he was doing behind my back. That thought hurts so much too. I am trying to come to terms with all this. He has asked for forgiveness but given the length of time he has been doing this I feel like its unforgivable.

The other vehicle initiated an illegal u turn from where he was parked. The road was two way and there were two lines going each direction with space for street parking on the sides of the road. The other  car his the car I was in just when he was about to cross the solid double yellow line. After speaking with the driver we understood that he is not going to admit his fault, but fortunately there was a dash camera in the first car. Still it was vary stressful situation.

128,"I have a niece, who I adore, and this is a day in our life. I picked her up around 9am so we could start our day having a fun breakfast at one of our favorite places to eat breakfast. Pine State Biscuit! We decided to throw all things ""diet"" out the door and partake in the most delicious and tasty waffles known to man. We had extra whip cream with a large amount of blueberries. Once we relaxed into our lovely surroundings we chatted for about an hour. We got caught up and re-connected, which was just what I was hoping for. We left with big smiles and satiated appetites. It was a gorgeous day outside. Blue sky, no clouds, slight breeze. So we then decided to take a walk. We thought this might help us digest our enormous intake of food. We found ourselves standing next to a regal movie theater. We looked at each other and just started laughing.  She, afterall, wants to be an actress. Well we just had to go inside to see what was playing.  It made complete sense that after that long walk we had to reward ourselves. In search of the latest and greatest movie we marched inside to investigate this funky little theater. We found exactly the movie we wanted, made our purchase and settled in. Some teenagers were making a tremendous amount of noise and my niece turned around and said: ""leave the theater if you plan to keep that up. Some of us actually are here to watch the movie and we'd like to listen"". She was so direct yet kind -I was so proud of her. They stopped talking immediately. Afterwards, food now settled nicely, it was time to head out to our favorite rink and roller skate. We skated until we felt like our legs could no longer move and ended our evening exhausted and promptly fell asleep.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,

Sarah was so messy, she would make food and eat it on the couch with no napkin or tray, so of course crumbs would get everywhere. It wouldn't have made me so mad had she at least vacuumed afterwards but no, she made no effort to clean. This is on top of coming home from work every night to seeing John's laundry strewn about the apartment, piled in the halls and filthy. I tried to communicate to them, I really did..

In the house were me, my husband, our teen daughter and her friend that was spending the night.  At first it was kind of adventurous.  We set up candles and used flashlights and just pretty much played games on our phones or whatever we could find in the dark to keep us occupied.  About two hours into this, we decided to go to the grocery store and we bought a lot of snacks.  After six hours it was late night and we were wondering if the power would ever come back on.  We called the power company and they said it could be awhile.  We went to bed and hoped for the best.  We woke up the next morning to no power still.  The power company was now telling us the outages were so bad it could be up to a week for us to regain power.  We were new to the neighborhood and didnt really know anyone.  We were worried about hot water, food going bad, etc.  We went out for the say to forget about things.  When we returned there was a generator sitting on our driveway with a note attached.  It was from our nextdoor neighbors who are in their mid to late sixties.  The note read ""you can use this generator to keep your refrigerator running so your food doesnt spoil.  it should last for several days""  I was so amazed and thankful.  I could not believe the kindness of people we didnt even know, that were in the same situation as us.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
131,"It was three weeks ago that I set out on my personal mission to test my fortitude. I cut out things in my life that were holding me back, making me negative, or were not conducive to being my best self. I gave myself one month to go without social media, lustful thoughts, cussing, television, and sweets. It's definitely been a challenge! Since most people are on a health kick after the New Year, giving up sweets has been relatively easy, though I do sometimes miss having something sweet after dinner. Losing a few pounds has encouraged me to stick with the sweet dessert abstinence. The hardest thing has been giving up television. I have felt very out of touch with what's going on in the world. I also miss some of my favorite shows and find myself wondering if I will have trouble following the story arc once I start watching again. Social media has been surprisingly easy to give up. I guess that's because the negativity on there was really getting to me. I don't miss the drama or the rudeness. I have also found that by focusing my thoughts more positively and not swearing, cussing, or thinking lustful thoughts, I have more energy for creative thoughts. I've written two new poems and have a new story idea to write! Overall, the experience has been very rewarding. It's made me feel stronger as a person and has proven my willpower and faith.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,

She was a high risk pregnancy and they had some complications, so that was kind of scary.   But after days of labor, and sitting around in the waiting room, she was finally born. She was actually born early so she was considered a premature baby.  She had to be hooked up to machines and tested, so there was a lot of anxiety for the first couple of day afterwards. But everything turned out fine and I couldn't be happier!  I've been wishing for this for a while now since I will probably never have kids of my own. So this way I can live vicariously through them. I got to meet her a couple of days after she was born and it was super exciting. I couldn't believe how tiny she was.  She was so small, I was afraid to hold her. Even weeks after she was born I still wouldn't hold her because of how fragile she was.

We would go to the park and run chasing each other. A few years ago she got sick with heart worms. We took her to the vet and she was prescribed a medication that fixed the issue. That's what caused what happened 10 weeks ago to be surprising. When she had another health issue, I expected it to be treatable. We took her to the vet who took a blood sample. He also took a biopsy. The results came back as cancer. He said we could try treating her. I knew that cancer was going to  cause a decline in her health. But I didn't expect the medication itself to cause an allergic reaction in her. During the first dosage, she went into cardiac arrest and we abruptly had to put her down.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,

It was surprising to me that we all seemed to pick up where we left off, so to speak.  We hadn't seen each other in a long time and it felt like yesterday.   I was shocked to see how my brother's two sons had grown so much!  They are now mature young, handsome men with great personalities.  What a joy they were to interact with!  We had planned to go on a little trip to do some wine tasting, so we did that.  We had to take two cars.  The city we went to was Woodinville.  It is a quaint little town with tons of wineries to visit.  We were a big group, so we went to wineries that could accommodate all of us.  The tasting was very enjoyable with good wine and lots of conversation.  After that, we investigated online where we should go out to dinner.  We found a well reviewed Italian restaurant and decided to go to it.  The ambiance was nice and we were very pleased.  Unfortunately, the reviews were terribly wrong!  The food was horrible and the service worse.  Oh well, we made the best of it.  My sister and I spent the night and left early in the morning.

His legs were getting very weak and he could no longer stand properly. We would have to give him his pain medication 3 times a times a day. Even then he would sometimes howl in pain periodically. My brother who had also grow up with Zeus suggested that it might be time to put the dog down. My-self and most of my immediate family were ready not to put him down so we decided to wait. this was a mistake, as the poor dog's condition worsened day by day. eventually it got to the point where the medication did not help ew had to come to a decision as a family. This was very emotionally taxing so we went to the vet to get a consult on the best possible action. We decided on this day june 20, 2019 that it was time for Zeus to be released. Released from was pain. Released from suffering. Released from the mortal plane.

Things were so hectic, after the breakup, with the difficulties at work, and how much I was eating just to try to distract myself from everything. I couldn't believe the person I was seeing when I was looking in the mirror back then. Thinking about that, I can't believe the person I'm seeing when I look in the mirror now. It really took me hitting rock bottom, when I was struggling to walk up the flight of stairs at home and was dead out of breath for me to finally look at myself and try to get a plan together to turn things around. But I did it! Thanks to all the hard work and the support of my friends, family, and community I found myself a part of at the local gym, I was able to stick to my plan and turn things around. It got really challenging at times, especially early on when I wasn't seeing any results. It was tough to see all my friends enjoying themselves, throwing down pizza and ice cream and not being able to be a part of it. But it was worth sticking to my plan. Hey, maybe I'll be able to join them soon! I hope I can be an inspiration to someone else at some point. I want to write down all the steps I took, and all the thoughts that went through my head, especially early on. There were a lot of times I doubted myself, so I want to make sure I make note of all those things in case I can pass them forward to someone else some day.

It's something like that, it is only understood by someone who has had to live it, others are only spectators who assume they know how it feels, but they really are not even close to imagining how it can feel. I fight a lot against this situation to be able to face it and eventually overcome it, since it is agonizing to live the feeling of guilt daily. I really hope to find the way out of this that haunts me. I need help. I never imagined that I would have to live my father's death, much less because of drugs. The funeral is very painful, seeing my broken mother fills me even more with sadness. My brothers are disconsolate, worried about what will come later. The absence of my father is something that will mark us all. I wish that nobody in the world used drugs, they have no idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe damage they do to their body. I hope that my story does not have to be lived by many other people, before becoming aware. My biggest refuge right now is God. I know that religion is a sensitive issue.

141,"Earlier this summer, I went to Denver for the first time since cannabis was legalized. I took the train (because I'm not a big fan of flying) from Chicago to Denver which took about 20 hours. It was by far the longest I've ever spent on a train, and I was super happy to finally get off in Denver, but the ride wasn't so bad. It's way more comfortable than flying because the seats are bigger, with lots of legroom and you can get up to walk around. They even have an observation car with giant windows, although it was usually crowded. Nobody was sitting next to me, so I had tons of room. And there was free wi-fi, so I watched Netflix and did all the normal things on my computer that I would have done if I was at home. All in all it was a pleasant ride. When I got to Denver, I had a few hours to kill before I could check into my hotel room. So I decided I would walk the 5 miles from the train station to the hotel. There just happened to be a nice bike/walking path along a creek that covered most of the distance. It wasn't in a hurry and it was a hot day, so I took my time. I saw lots of breaks to sit and watch the cyclists and joggers pass by. When I finally got to the hotel, I was pretty sweaty and red in the face, and I still had a little more time to kill. So I found a bathroom and freshened up and relaxed in the lounge for a bit. Then I checked in and went to my room. From a quick internet search I saw that there were about 5 dispensaries all within walking distance from my hotel and I could see 3 of them from my room. So I picked the one that had the best reputation and went to buy legal cannabis for the first time. When you first walk into the dispensary, it looks like a boring waiting room. You give your ID to someone and then they buzz you into the main room where everything is for sale. Then you assigned a ""budtender"" who helps you choose what you want to buy. I had no idea what I wanted, so that was helpful. I ended up buying some edibles, which I tried that night. It was my very first experience with cannabis and I slept like a happy baby.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

Everything was in those bags...clothes, toothbrushes, etc.   We had nothing! We were told our bags would arrive in two days, so we unfortunately spent our first night of vacation going shopping for necessities to hold us over until our bags arrived.

Needless to say...it was not the start to my birthday vacation that I was hoping for.  Four months later, we are now engaged.  It didn't happen at the restaurant that second night as I had hoped, but I was able to do it on our last night there because our suitcases DID eventually arrive.

After putting in sweat, tears and many countless hours I was angry more than anything when I heard the words, ""unfortunately, we cannot let you continue into the program."" I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, ""well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?"" Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are ""safe"" and that we will receive help. I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward.

He came back and told me that my Dad was interested in learning finger picking on guitar after listening to me play. I cried a little, thinking of all the times in my life that a kind word from my father would have made a difference. Still waters the eyes to think of it. The thing is, my son bridged the gap, made me rethink my Dad. You do that any way as you age. I guess Mark Twain was an early bloomer when he said he was amazed by how much smarter his Dad had gotten when Twain turned 21. I am still reconsidering what I once thought of as a lifetime of him trying to Father and Son Song me into silence. ( From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen, thank you to Yusuf Islam.)

He is growing so fast and I am so proud of every little accomplishment he achieves. I enjoy watching him play with the cat and the dog. We have had to move a lot of things to higher places that he cannot reach. I had to redo my home theatre system because he kept pushing buttons that I did not want him to press. I am willing to do the extra work around the house so that he has a safe and functional environment to play and learn in. I am lucky enough to work from home so I get to be around him all the time. It is great to be able to spend so much time with him and help him learn and develop his skills. I look forward to the day that he takes his next step and begins to walk. That experience will present its own challenges and I look forward to facing those with him.

The trip was 1 week long so we were constantly going out and enjoying ourselves since we wanted to do a lot in such a short amount of time. Once we arrived we got settled at our hotel, and then the next day we went out to see the volcanoes and then went to dinner. The day after that we went horseback riding in the rain forest and saw lots of different trees as well as a waterfall. The horseback riding was the most memorable part of the trip, as we were able to slowly climb up the mountain through the rain forest, and then saw the sunset over the ocean. The views we saw on the horseback riding trip were amazing. I was surprised by the vastness of the ocean and the beauty of the sunset. The next day we went golfing and saw plenty of mongoose, wild birds, and goats along the course. The next day we enjoyed lazing around on the beach and going to a luau. I ended up getting a bit of a sunburn that day, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the trip. The day after that we went to a lagoon and saw dolphins and sea turtles swimming in the ocean. The next morning we spent driving to the airport where we could see plenty of rock formations. We had a layover in Oahu that was 12 hours long, so we were able to explore the city outside of the airport and saw some of the ocean and beaches.

He had just been through a divorce and his ex left him little to nothing. We all felt bad for him so I personally invited him to join us. Spending time with him we were able to get his mind off the divorce. Within a few hours he slowly grew back into his old self. We all had a lot of fun together. I honestly hadn't felt this way since we were kids. With all the work and crap of regular life it's hard to stop and just enjoy life with friends. My friend was suicidal, and I was genuinely worried for his well being. So I got an excuse to look after him as well.

I had to take him to the vet because he had been coughing and refusing to eat his prescribed kitty food. He was just having a hard time of it. I finally got him to the vet and he was able to get out of the car. I should say that he cried the whole time we were driving. I had to turn the music up to drown him out. I dont want to be mean, but he was really crying. Finally we got him to the vet and he calmed down a little. He got his urine checked and is having problems with allergies. The cat might have asthma.

We'd lived all together for a year prior. My girls and I moved back to Indiana where their dad lives. They are adorable together. You'd think they'd grown up together, so it was especially lovely reuniting them. We spent long day of swimming at the pool, teaching them pinball, and playing outside. Then we set camp chairs up out back at dusk to relax. The sun began to set. The youngest noticed the first fireflies. Within 15 minutes we'd punched holes in 3 mason jar lids for them to catch fireflies. Watching our little girls run around barefoot in the dark catching fireflies was a truly lovely moment. The simplicity of screen-free old-fashioned entertainment was heartwarming, especially when the littlest caught her first firefly. By the time they grew tired, they each had a jar full of flashing little bugs. While my boyfriend and I have struggled to maintain our relationship, I am so proud and grateful of how we've nurtured our girls' relationships with each other and can continue to give them lovely life experiences together.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
158,A very memorable thing happened to me was about 4 months ago. My son got a job in a completely different city and state and even part of the country than we live in. I needed to help him search for apartments. I had to find something that would be safe and something that was a little cheaper. This was an emotional time for me because even though my son has been off to college and graduate school he was always in the same state as me.  We needed to help him pack up his things from his Graduate School apartment and get him off to start his new career and life. I was very sad and happy and proud at the same time. I think that part of me didn't want him to move away.  It made me think about when I was his same age and it was at that time that I moved away from my family. I remembered how my father cried and cried. He was very sad and didn't want me to go. Little did I know that would be the last time I saw him. So it made me think about that as I was packing up my son's things. I am grateful for today's technology that allows us to physically see each other. I will miss the face to face time.,memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
159,"Dear Journal,I can't believe it actually happened. After barely speaking to her, my mother finally apologized for everything that she put me through. This all happened around 5 months ago when I got a call from mom telling me that she wanted us to have lunch. I was completely shocked to hear from her. I really didn't want to go, but she seemed dead set on having us meet over lunch. When the day finally came for us to meet, I started remembering all of the emotional abuse that she put me through growing up. I drove to the new Italian place in town that she wanted us to have lunch at. She was already there sitting at a small table outside. We greeted each other as friendly as we both could and we ordered our food. I finally broke the awkward small talk and asked her why she wanted to meet out of the blue. Thats when it happened. She started crying and asking for my forgiveness. While continuing crying, she apologized for all of the things that she did to me. I was starting to get embarrassed as other people were looking over at our table. Awhile ago I had said that I would never forgive her for the constant insults and verbal abuse that she hurled at me over the years. But in that moment, I saw the sincerity and remorse in her eyes. She wanted to try to fix the things that she had done. I accepted her apology and we had started the first step in rebuilding our relationship. Its only been five months since this day, but I am proud of the progress that my mother and I have made. We talk regularly know and I feel closer to her then ever before.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,
160,"Three months ago me and Kreig stopped being best friends. It was a sad day for me.  I look back on it and I could see it happening. We were best friends in high school and grew apart a little in college but still remained close. Then life happened. we both got full time jobs in different cities and that life thing kicked in. You know that part of being best friends is shared experiences and being able to remember them, talk about them and laugh. We had some great times when we were younger and hung out all the time, games, concerts ( the fight at ZZ top), and hunting. But, time moves on and people grow apart with distance, time,  and meeting other people. I know that is what happened to us. I feel really sad this happened because he was my best friend for almost 15 years. That being said, I know that we will keep in contact but it just wont be the same as it use to be. That makes me sad because Kreig was in my life for so long. I hope one day that we both can build a relationship as strong with someone else and be able to have those shared memories and laughs.

I mean after all their hard work in raising me I thought that it would be nice if I return the favor. And so I did. That's why I brought them the tickets. They had a lot of fun over the vacation, and they sent me many pictures! It was great! I enjoyed it as much as they did, vicariously. I'm glad I brought them those tickets.

There was a trampoline too, so that kids were definitely all shaken and not stirred by the end of the day haha. Even though Jimmy is too young to really have friends we wanted to make it a big to do and invite everyone over so we had all the neighbors with their kids over. There was even drinks for the adults haha, had to keep them all occupied some how. I've been planning this day for a few months now, I wanted to make sure that Jimmy's first birthday was extra special. I just want to have all the best pictures to show him when he's older. I made him a great big old chocolate cake and when we gave it to him with the single candle to blow out he took his fists and slammed into the cake haha. Thankfully I had two cakes because I knew that he was likely to try and smash this one, he is such a rambunctious little boy. I actually catered out another cake for the adults and older kids to have a slice from, but Jimmy got to really destroy the big one I baked! My best memory of the day was his smile covered with sticky icing as he waved his hands around happily. It was a bit of a mess to clean up but he was so happy. I love making him smile, and he's gotten so big already! I can't believe a year has passed already, time sure is flying! I hope next year is just as fun.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,

I spent the next few months alone but was very unhappy and lonely so I decided to get a companion dog. I didn't want a puppy as I was not interested in training him/her. I started looking into a rescue greyhound from a local rescue. The rescue seem to take the process very seriously and I liked what they stood for. I paid a visit to them with my girlfriend and since it was 50 miles away I was expecting to see a few dogs to choose from. They had two. The first had a lot of medical issues that was a bit much for me  to handle so I did not meet her. The second was a couple of years older than I was anticipating but thought it would be nice to meet her. She was black with while socks and white tip on her tail, very pretty dog. I walked her around the yard and she was so sweet. She did everything I wanted to and seem to have the saddest eyes when she looked up at me. She is 7 years old and seemed to be healthy. She was born in Australia and was raced in China for many years. They closed the race track there and she was kept as one of 600 dogs with no where to go. The rescue group close to me heard of these dogs and was able to get 20 of them out of China. Of the 600 dogs, only 300 were made healthy enough to be rescued out of the country. I couldn't resist, I brought her home. That was 5 months ago. Since then she has become my constant companion. No matter what room I am in, she finds a spot to sit and watch me. Her physical went well and has no known medical issues. Love my dear dog.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

We were all headed up to the new building our company opened up to make sure that we had everything we needed for contractors, power, and other needs.  It was not a bad day weather wise.  It was slightly cooler than normal, but overall a nice day.  The traffic wasn't too bad either.  Heading into Boston during a work day can be frustrating with all the traffic you have to deal with.  We were probably about a half an hour from our destination.  I was sitting behind the driver, my boss was to the right of me and there was another co-worker in the passenger seat.   All of a sudden I heard my co-worker whom was driving say, 'oh crap!', and I looked forward and saw a box truck slam on its break.  Then like a bullet I saw a Fed-ex truck swerve.  From there it went right to left and went head on into a guard rail.  Time seemed to slow at this time, almost like in a movie.  The fed-ex truck's back end came inward and the truck began to flip over the rail.  It was all so surreal.  The traffic stopped and we saw the drive unclip his belt and hit the roof of the truck from within.  At that point we felt that he was good to go and other passer bys stopped by to help him.

167,"Well, what immediately comes to mind is an event that occurred on the 1st of May. At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day. As gloomy as this sounds though, I firmly believe that good can absolutely still come of it. If handled properly it can lead to a dramatically improved mode of being.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

His symptoms improved. He was getting stronger. We were happy for him. He always dreamed about walking his daughter down the aisle to her husband. When the wedding day came around, he was able to do this. We were happy. He was excited too. He did the honors, and my sister was happy. She is now happily married. My father is healthy and strong.

182,"Two weeks ago our cat, Baby Kitty didn't come home. I spent two days searching for her, checking the road, checking the animal shelters, emailing the shelters. I checked the cars to be sure she was not stuck anyplace. I was super upset that she was missing since a different cat had gone missing before only to find out that one of our neighbors must have taken it. This story is about the misadventures of our missing cat. Then I went outside one evening a few days later and Baby Kitty came stumbling out of the garage. She could not stand up at all and her head was tilted to the side. She seemed to be in a lot of distress about not standing up, so I grabbed the cat carrier and off we went to the Emergency Vet, since of course this happened after the normal vets are closed. The emergency vet is not really very close since we live in a rural area, so it took about a half hour of listening to her cry to get there! I was super upset and worried about her since I did not know what was wrong with her. The vet diagnosed her with Idiopathic Vestibular Disease, which is sort of a catch all for a few possible causes, inflammation in the brain, or inner ear infection or a brain tumor. They said the only way to tell if it was a brain tumor was with an MRI, which they don't really recommend as a first step. They suggested trying antibiotics first to see if there was any improvement and hope that it was not a brain tumor! We got antibiotics and came home. Baby Kitty had to spend a week in our bathroom since she could not walk very well and I was concerned she would fall down the stairs! My oldest son had to give her the medicines twice a day while we were on Vacation too, so I was worried about him doing it right. Baby Kitty is doing much better, still a bit wobbly and has a slight head tilt still, so we will have to bring her back to the vet for a follow up. The most memorable event of this whole incident is we still do not know where Baby Kitty was for three days when she was missing. We also don't know if the disease happened because she was stuck someplace or if she got stuck because she lost the ability to walk somehow. This whole incident was super upsetting because the last time we had to go to the Emergency Vet our dog did not make it.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
183,"Our family, consisting of my wife and 8-year old son, recently went on a road trip, driving all the way from Kentucky to Toronto. The plan involved stops in Columbus as well as Niagara Falls, the main attraction of our trip. One day before our trip, my wife found out that her US passport had expired four months ago. Nevertheless, we decided to proceed with our trip and hope for the best. We stayed a night at Columbus, and took the opportunity to visit the Science Museum and also spend some time at TopGolf for a few shots. The next day we drove all the way to Niagara Falls on the US side. It was really fun, and our first time there. We took a tour around Hurricane Deck which put us right next to some falls, and we all enjoyed getting wet. It was especially memorable for me, because I had not felt this much joy and togetherness, due to recent marital problems I had been experiencing. After a brief tour of the Falls, we decided to drive to our hotel on the Canadian side. We were slightly nervous, because of my wife's expired passport. Delightfully, the Canadian border patrol did not even notice. We proceeded to our hotel which had a wonderful view of the Falls. We spent two nights there, exploring every activity we could find time to do. Our next stop was Toronto. WE took the opportunity to try some great Chinese food before checking into our hotel. The highlight was visiting the CN tower and watching the sunset at the top. After a couple of nights, we started our journey back home. Again we became quite nervous at the border crossing. The agent asked me a bunch of questions (as I was the only non-US citizen) before notifying my wife that her passport had expired. We pretended to be shocked, and I offered the agent my wife's drivers license, but the agent said he didn't need it. He just wanted us to know of the expired passport so that we could fix it when we got home. That was a nice way to end our trip.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

185,"Going to visit my dad's new family was hard at first. I've wrote about the divorce and how messy it was. That's why it took so long to visit him. When he cheated on my mom, I never thought that I could forgive him. Years later, I decided that I am old enough and I can handle this. I reached out to him to see if I can come visit. He was surprised but sounded really happy about it. I took my family to his place and we sat in silence for a little while. His new wife was the woman he cheated on my mom with and was the reason that they got a divorce. She took my kids outside and they played. I told my dad that I was there to figure out why he did it. I needed answers so I could forgive and move on from this. He explained everything. After sitting and crying for a while with him about how much of the past few years we have missed from each other, we hugged and patched things up. My kids came running in and talking about catching frogs with my dad's wife and how much fun it was. My wife took to my dad's wife as well. What I thought would have been a horrible experience, ended up being one of the best ones. It's great to understand why my dad did things and it's also great to see him so happy now.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,
186,"Last week I had one of the most thrilling days of my life, and I couldn't be happier about the experience. On a trip out in Tahoe, I rented bikes along with my girlfriend and rode nearly all the way around the entire lake. We started on the North side of the lake, and geared up at the local information center to ensure we had the proper route. After packing up supplies and filling our water bottles, we began our trek in the early hours of the morning. Weaving through paths along one of the most beautiful lakes in the country was a blast, and we often decided to stop and take pictures on our phone to make sure we could soak it all in. We rode more than ten miles south through numerous towns and private roads along the nicely paved bike path, and then opted to stop at a local pizza place for a quick bite. To our surprise the garlic chips we ordered as a snack actually came out on a large tray, and it became clear this restaurant had a different name for their cheese bread. Both of us were shocked at first but ultimately happy with our delicious treat, which we devoured in a few minutes. Once we finished our drinks and paid our check, it was time to head back in the same direction we came to finish off our great bike trip. Before we finally pulled back into the lot near our car, we decided to stop for a few minutes on a nearby beach and take in our amazing views of the lake one last time. After numerous pictures and a few final sips from our water bottles we hopped aboard our bikes and rode the final few miles back to where we started. Despite being quite tired from such a long ride that spanned well into the afternoon, we both agreed that this place was an amazing destination that would be worth coming back to. Our decision to rent bikes also proved to be a great idea. We agreed it was the best way to explore such a great area that many people often speed right through with their car. We have already planned a repeat trip back to the lake, and I know both of us will be counting down the days until we can go back. Next time we will definitely bring our own bikes however!",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
187,"I went to a nearby city to meet up with family members for a very memorable family reunion.  There were about 12 of us in all. We went out to dinner at a very nice Chinese restaurant. My brother, who is a math professor, is very precise in his language.  He requires precision from everyone around him.  He started asking a lot of questions about the food options. The waiter became offended, even though there was nothing offensive about the questions. But the waiter didn't like my brother's tone of voice.  At one point he stepped back and said ""I don't need to be talked to like that.""  It was kind of sad. I realized that my brother has no idea how he comes off when he's in professorial mode.  My brother ended up getting something he didn't really love, because he felt bad about what happened, and had decided to stop asking questions.  In the end, the food was good, the company was good, the moment was forgotten, and the waiter got a pretty nice tip.  And it was good to see my brother. We had an excellent rest of the reunion.  I'm probably the only one who still recalls the moment.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,
188,"I just can't believe what I saw a couple of weeks back.  A guy parked his car in a disabled spot and got out to go in to the store.  At the same time a lady pulled up next to him and shouted to him out of the car window.  At the time I couldn't really see what was going on but I figured it out myself.  The guy had parked in a disabled spot and not displayed a tag.  The lady was disabled and was asking him to do so as she needed the spot.  The guy ran in to the store and the woman waited for him.  By the time he came out she was, understandably irate.  He just lost it and started calling her all sorts of horrible names which related to her being unable to walk.  It was just unreal to see such anger and hate in the world.  I decided at that point had to intervene.  I got out of my car and walked over toward where they were arguing.  I sided with the lady, of course.  I couldn't keep my emotions in check though! I just screamed at the man until I was blue in the face.  Some people just need to be told.",memories,1,False,,,,,,,,,

I had finished work, and my wife had asked me to get ready because we were going to dinner together.  Our children were ""at the babysitter"" (that's what I was told).  So, I quickly dressed.  I really did not want to leave, but I was hungry.  What I did not know is that my wife had gathered my family together for a surprise birthday party at O'Charleys.  We arrived about 5:30pm.  When we entered the ""party section"" of the restaurant, everyone shouted, ""Surprise.""  I really was taken aback.  I wondered why we were headed back to that section in the first place!  I didn't expect that my wife would actually do something like that.  She is sweet, but not much of one on surprises.  On top of my wife's surprise, everyone in my family was there.  Some had traveled a few hours to be with us on that evening.  It meant the world to me to have my family and a few friends come out to celebrate my birthday with me.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

I purchased a bunch of pink flamingo decor to decorate the walls and tables.  I purchased a cute flamingo puffy straw to adorn the party cups.  I played music by Marshmello, who is her favorite musician.  For her gifts, I purchased her a bunch of squishes, and some play make up.  We had all of her cousins come, which totaled about 10 kids.  We had games like pinata hitting, hula hoop competition, and limbo.  Her cake I decorated pink and purple with many pastel colored sprinkles.  This birthday was a large celebration as she has always dreamed of having a horse again.  Unfortunately, our property is small and we could no longer afford the board in our area for a horse.  So, we sold the one we had years ago.  This year, I was able to gift her with something that most people wouldn't even think would matter to a young girl.  I was able to tell her we were buying a house out in the country that had enough acreage for a horse!  She was over the moon excited.  Our little half acre lot that we lived in would eventually turn into 10 acres in our new home.  She would have the room to ride and play like she had always dreamt of doing.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

She had had knee surgery in the past and was unable to make it to the top due to her knee pain.  WE were determined we were going to make it this time.  WE started at around 8:00 am that morning.  Although it was very hard because it was up hill the whole way I made it to the top.  Two of our party did not make it to the top but tried their best.  Of the ones who made it, it took us 4 hours to make it all the way to the top.  We were exahausted but elated we had reached our goal!  The way down didn't take nearly as long because it was mostly down hill.  It took about 2 and a half hours to make the journey back to our car.  On our way back down we met up with the two in our party who did not make it to the top although they had made great progress.  They were disappointed and vowed to make it to the top the next time we went.  I really enjoyed our hiking expeirence although it was very taxing.  I would love to try again in the future and see if we can make it to the top faster the next time.",memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

We woke up in the morning and exchanged words, kisses, and gifts, as we had officially been dating for 5 years! After we had woken up we made breakfast and sat and talked about what we should do for the day as we had our whole day free. She smirked and acted as if she had something to say but was holding back. After a moment it's as if she burst and with a wide grin she explained how she had a surprise planned and I had an hour to pack. Excited and nervous, I quickly threw clothes and necessities into a bag and before I knew it we were on our way! We drove into the city and on the way we listened to our favorite songs, laughed, and talked about our days' plans. We checked into the pre-booked hotel room and jumped on the bed. After settling in we left and explored the city. Although we've been to the city numerous times, it's always exciting to visit our favorite spots and look for things we'd missed or forgotten about. We ate plenty of great food, saw plenty of cute dogs (our favorite), and had a day full of love. It's always nice getting surprised and I was so taken back by her actually planning all of this without me knowing!

I got out and checked on them and made sure they were okay. I then called the cops and me and the other driver started talking. She was young, had a kid in her car and told me that she didn't have insurance and was really sorry. We talked some more and I started to feel bad about her situation. She was crying and didn't know what to do. She had just gotten laid off from work, couldn't get a babysitter because she had no money. It was really said. When the cops finally arrived, we filled out paper work and she told them she didn't have insurance. She got a ticket for that and broke down. I had so little damage on my car that I told her that I wasn't going to file anything. I'll just repair this and she didn't have to worry about anything. She was so relieved about that!

194,I recently came across some new books about traditions. It is a very awesome rundown of historical events. Events today that we celebrate as holidays. These events were from pagan traditions. Obviously my first thought was this has to be a joke. As i continued further in my research i did come to find alot of errors. What and how we celebrate these events is just wrong. These events are pagan in nature. They also hide and mask the true meanings of these events. I wasn't expecting to be so entrenched. Once again having to do with the holidays as being pagan. I further learned about the satanic origins of these events. These events played out differently years ago. Many children were kidnapped for sacrifice. Many parents were killed if they did not produce youths. These were dark times. Some not have any children out of fear. These events happened every year. A salute to pagan gods. These events were a blight on our human race. It makes me very angry. This hits close to home. I'm so glad i found this book and learned the truth. I will no longer let these events be present in my life. I am changed from all of this and for the better.,memories,1,True,,,,,,,,,

Over the years I've loaned them quite a bit of money (which they never repay) when I've been optimistic that they're straightening out their lives and need help to move forward.  This July they lost their jobs as motel managers in Utah and returned here, homeless with two cats and a dog.  They moved into my daughter's garage and went on a ten-day bender.  They neglected their pets, had violent arguments, didn't return their U-Haul which was about to be reported as stolen, etc.  My daughter asked my son's wife to leave after she made a drunken scene insulting her neighbors.  She got a motel room and decided she'd just like to stay there.  My daughter and I handled everything for them and my son eventually snapped out of it.  He asked me if he could borrow $250 which he'd repay when he got a check in the mail in a few days and I foolishly agreed.  The check did come and he called me and said he was coming right over with the money and asked if he could do some laundry.  I haven't seen him since.  He took the money and paid for some more nights in the motel room and lots of vodka.  I was taking care of his dog who howled all day and night with separation anxiety.  I've been worried and scared for my son's health and safety for a long time but after this incident, that's changed into anger and fear for my own safety from people who absolutely put alcohol ahead of everything in life.

This was a man she was quite close to as she spent a lot of her summers growing up with her grandparents.  It had happened suddenly, so she didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  A couple days after this call, she came over, dark circles under her eyes.  She asked if I would go to the funeral with her as she didn't think she could go without me.  I of course agreed, although I was pretty uncomfortable.  I'd never been to one before.  The day of the funeral, I dressed in a dark suit, picked up my girlfriend, and drove over to the church for his service.  There were so many vehicles in the lot that it was difficult to find a spot to park.

My body was aging and I wasn't as young as I use to be. After going to the ER and hearing the Doctor tell me I had a mild heart attack, I was in shock. He told me that I may have a major heart attack following or even mini strokes. I felt this may have been God's message to slow me down. I know he was telling me, he was there for me.

There were so many different decorations that were all so new to me because I had never been to Hawaii. All the different colorful flowers, the gorgeous hula girls and their colorful outfits, everything was perfect. The only sad part is that a lot of family and friends could not make it because it was so far and expensive to travel there. But, when we least expected it, our friends from back home showed up which was a huge surprise. It was actually surprising of them because they usually do not like to spend money on traveling for less than a week but they made it out. I think they purposely told us they could not make it so they can surprise us. My friends, my sister's friends, and her finance's friends were all there. I was so happy that their best friends showed up for them. But, not to be selfish, I was also happy that I would be able to spend the last day after the wedding in Hawaii with all of my friends.

Still, there's always that anxiety when welcoming drastic change in life, and this may be the most drastic change of mine. I only wish I could have gotten to know my fellow classmates better. I'll never know, but I feel like there were lifelong friendships that could have been had if I put myself out there. And as I was on that stage I'll never forget how excited I saw all my peers, i'm sure each story they had to tell was just as exciting. I won't give the excuse of how busy I so frequently was, or how my involvement with band made things that much more unlikely. Speaking of band, I've had so many good and bad stories to tell. My most memorable would have to be while performing at a tournament. One of the band teams was so off their own instructor quit mid performance! I felt sorry for that group, it was so embarrassing to watch. We on the other hand got second place among stiff competition. That speaks to how close we are as a group and how in sync we were.

403,"Two months ago I was surprised to receive an offer of employment from my former organization. It was unexpected but I thought this reflected well on my past performance as an employee. It appears that the organization is going through a restructure and my former employer thought my input and guidance would be useful during this challenging period. My former manager, who asked me to return as manager of a newly forming team, said he believed I would be a great asset in bringing old and new employees together to help drive the organization forward. He also said my old team had been affected by my retirement and their productivity was not quite as good as it had been under my leadership. Admittedly, I do miss my former colleagues and team but I do not miss the pressure of my former position and having new and harder targets to achieve on a regular basis - not only was it hard for me but even harder leading others to achieve. My former industry is becoming more and more competitive as new technologies are released and more talented people are attracted into the area. My former manager also offered me a significant pay rise and good bonus potential. I was very tempted by this offer especially as my 401k and social security could use the boost! That said there are many aspects of the job I don't want to repeat even with the temptation of potentially new ways of doing things. I was happy to retire as I was getting very tired and stressed by the demands of the organization and industry. I do not think I have the energy and ambition to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of the job. Still, the offer had me torn and I asked for a week to think things over. My former manager said that would be fine and he hoped I would return. During that week I called some former colleagues to find out what had been going on within the organization since I had retired. They all agreed, separately, that the industry has indeed become much more competitive and the organization was struggling to keep up, hence the restructure. Most commented that it had been and still was a difficult and stressful time. Some said they envied my retirement and wished they could do the same! The things my colleagues said helped me make up my mind to turn down the offer. I enjoy being retired too much to return to a highly stressful job. I love being able to spend much more time with my grandchildren and money isn't too tight. I don't have expensive tastes any way.

I figure she‚Äôs just organising her families calendar, so I say ‚Äúnothing as of yet, when I do it might just be low key pizzas at our house‚Äù (We are actually organising something so we can announce we are pregnant to his family!)And she writes a spiel about her MLM (I forgot she was involved in) and how she can host a party for me and my friends and it will be loads of fun and we will get loads of freebies and blah blah blah. And I instantly get a cold sweat, I wonder how I can explain to her that I‚Äôm fundamentally against supporting MLMs without pissing her off, if it‚Äôs less hassle to just let her throw one, while also being irritated that she would even ask.  Every invite I‚Äôve received from her so far on FB, I‚Äôve just ignored, hoping she wouldn‚Äôt notice me among all the other women she invited. Then the hormone monster took over for a second, and I  wrote ‚ÄúNo, thank you‚Äù and hit send. And she wrote back ‚ÄúOh, OK‚Äù And that‚Äôs it!  And now I‚Äôm sitting here with a stupid grin on my face because I feel relieved that I didn‚Äôt do what I normally would do which is stew over it for days, trying to figure out how to tiptoe around the issue, or bean dip, meanwhile stressing myself out.                                                                                                                                                                                 My original instinct was not to ‚Äúgo on a rant‚Äù, it was the feeling of needing to justify my response, and the stress of trying to figure out how to justify my lack of wanting to be involved, without hurting any feelings. I did not say that MLM people are crazy monsters.  I do think the MLM business model is unethical and I hate having friends and family trying to sell me things.  But that wasn‚Äôt my point of posting. My point was that I was trying to come up with a good excuse or response and was feeling stressed about it, when all I needed to say was ‚Äúno‚Äù.  I‚Äôm very bad at doing that, and it felt good to do so.  I did the same thing throughout my wedding, so I thought I‚Äôd share as a reminder that it‚Äôs okay to say no.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,
407,"4 months ago, I was dating a guy named Brian DeFranco. At first I thought he was everything that I always wanted in a man. Not only did he work a full time job but he also helped around the house, treated me and my daughter like royalty, and was faithful. He had mentioned numerous times throughout our relationship that he had a rough past, but never did either of us imagine that it would catch up to him like it did in the most embarrassing way possible. One weekend, me, Brian, and my daughter Diamond were all eating breakfast when suddenly there was a loud banging on the door. ""Open up this is the police!"" a man cried.This startled me, but Brian seemed unfazed as he quickly and quietly got up from the table and started to make his way towards the bedroom. I asked him where he was going but he wouldn't tell me. All he said was to act like he had been missing for days to save myself. I watched in horror as opened the window and climbed out without uttering another word as the police continued to knock. ""Hold on, I'm coming!"" I said, closing the window and leaving the bedroom to walk to the main door. My daughter was in tears. ""Where did Brian go?"" she wailed. I shushed her, composed myself, and opened the door. As soon as I did, five police officers swarmed in and they went about raiding my entire apartment. ""Excuse me. What is going on?"" I said. One of the police officers told me that they were looking for my boyfriend as apparently he had murdered his father. I did my best to remain calm. ""He asked if I had seen him around lately. I lied and told him no and that it had been a few days. ""He's not here so please leave, you all are scaring my daughter."" After they'd finished searching, the police all gathered around in my living room. They asked me more questions about Brian and then they left, saying that they'd let me know when they found him. I remember crying for hours after the'd left and wondering things went so wrong so fast? Days later, I received a call that they did find Brian in another state and he was in police custody. He's now sitting in jail where he'll remain for 30 years without parole for manslaughter of his father William DeFranco.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
408,I never thought about math as something to struggle with. Numbers came easily to me and so did math. When I was asked to TA a class over the summer I was a bit apprehensive because I didnt know what I was supposed to really help with. The professor teaching the class really struggled with explaining things in a meaningful way. Those that took an interest in learning came to me and loved my explanations. I was told 3 weeks ago by the school that they had gotten many glowing positive comments from the students. They were very appreciative of how i listened to them and helped them. it really made me feel good about how I teach and what i could do to help. I am considering doing another course in the fall provided I can get the job back. I also considered getting an adjunct job after graduating with my masters. Sometimes its a matter of taking the time to listen to the needs of others. It was humbling to be involved in such an impactful way. I will always remember the kind comments I got. I hope others can learn from me and share what I shared. Overall this was a very positive experience.,memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,

We were so close, we even moved into the same house together. As soon as I got a boyfriend after college, we started to fade away from each other's lives. I wish that we had kept in contact, but people drift away. I was shocked when my now husband asked me ""Didn't you know Janet?"" and I said ""Man, Janet! Yes! Why?"" and he told me that she had passed away. I was shocked! I went to her funeral and talked to old friends of ours. They started talking about how we all went for coffee and donuts before it became a huge fad with teens. After the funeral, I went to Dunkin Donuts and got a dozen donuts and a large coffee. I sat in the parking lot eating and crying. I wish I could say that that was the only time I did that. It wasn't. I did this every week for months. Sometimes, when I got really sad, I'd do it multiple times. In 3 months, I gained 25 pounds. I knew I had to get a hold of myself.

Luckily both my parents were home at the time and called 911. The ambulance came out picked me up to take me to the hospital, although I was told I had kind of regained consciousness before they arrived. I work up in the hospital to my whole family being there, at least that is what they told me as my memory of the day is hazy, which was nice. It was the since I was liked 4 years old that I had ever been in a hospital. I basically just sat on a bed while they ran tests on me. Luckily nothing was bad at all, I had no broken bones or trauma or anything. I did have to stay overnight in the hospital just so they could evaluate me to me fully sure I was fine since I was still very lightheaded. My family left to go home, although my mother did stay overnight at the hospital with me since she insisted. I got discharged in the morning and came home. I then spend the next two weeks recovering as I had to let my head recover. My memory was also not very good during that time but everything is back to normal now. My brother took a picture of me when I was out of it on the hospital bed. It is funny to look back at now, although I still basically have a fuzzy memory regarding the events of the day. This was the first time in my life I have had to deal with a serious injury, as before this the worst thing to happened to me was just stuff like stubbing my toe. It was also my first time having to deal with hospital bills in the aftermath, that was a lot of fun. Luckily, I had insurance so it was not as bad as it could have been.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

We bought candles, plates, balloons, and other things to decorate the room. The most memorable part of the event was lighting the candles. We had put so many candles on the birthday cake that the flames started to merge into one. The birthday person had to blow out the candles quickly, otherwise the flames might have reached the cake! It took a while for them to blow out all the candles. But after that we sang happy birthday and enjoyed the celebration. We enjoyed eating the cake and talking about things at the party. We had things like champagne and small chocolate morsels. I remember enjoying the party a lot. The cake was big and very flavorful. It was made of chocolate and vanilla.

There was an incident in the parking lot of my apartment complex. A young girl was murdered and it was shocking to the entire community. The police investigated the incident and managed to find two suspects that seemed to fit the events of what happened. It seems that the suspects were also accused of murdering a 17 year old girl in the same fashion about a couple of months before this one. Everyone was at ease learning that the perpetrators have been caught. However, a few months after the incident, the suspects were released. The police did not mention why or if they had any additional leads on the situation. To say the least, our community was up in arms about it. There were complaints to the police department, detective in charge and even to the mayor! It was all very confusing. Not only that, the released suspects weren't even charged in the previous incident before this one. We are all still in a state of shock over it. We are not sure what we are going to do. People are acting a little on edge now, hoping the situation doesn't happen again. Sigh...I may think about moving. I'm not sure yet.

I took them to Carowinds, an amusement park, one day and to a putt putt another day. Treated them to dinner at times and took them to ice cream, also.  The days I took them to swim practice, I was able to go off  to McDonald's or shopped at Home Depot until their practice was over. Otherwise, I would stay and just play games or do a little work on my phone. Carowinds was a great time for all of us. Even though I don't care for rides much anymore, I did do some for them. We all enjoyed a full day there. It ended up being a great 2 weeks. The kids really took to me since I don't get to see them much. I think they fully enjoyed their Uncle.

We were making our holiday plans and I got a phone call from a mysterious phone number. Even though I don't usually answer calls from unknown numbers, I had a feeling that something may be wrong. You know that feeling you get when something just isn't right. You can't really explain it, but there's just something not right about things. I weird omen perhaps. Whatever it was, I knew it had to be important, so I answered the phone. The all was from an old college friend of mine who I hadn't seen in over 10 years. Ginny's voice sounded very strange, a bit shaky, not like the person I knew in college. The last time I talked to her, she had just been through a very serious round of chemotherapy, but was taking it like a champ and was in full remission. Why was she calling me, I wondered, but knew the answer. Her cancer had returned and was in full force now. I listened to my friend talk, and tried to encourage her as she fought back the tears. She was calling me to say goodbye.  I always think of myself as a strong woman, not easily swayed by emotions, but Ginny's story brought me to tears as well.

When I got hired onto the newspaper, I was extatic. But getting my first portrait published into a national magazine was a huge milestone. To see MY picture. Right there on the cover.

417,I was looking to buy a car but I didn't have transportation at the time so my options were limited. I finally found a BMW 328i close enough to ride my bike to see. I contacted the seller and made plans to see it that Sunday. I had been withdrawing cash every week to be sure I had enough to buy a car when I found one but I needed enough money in my bank account to cover the cost of insurance so I'd be able to drive it home. On Thursday I made certain to transfer the funds I needed well before the cutoff time. A little while later I got an email that the transfer failed. I found a reddit thread stating others were having the same problem. The withdrawal had to be done before about 5:00 or I knew it wouldn't be in my account. I tried throughout the day every 30 to 45 minutes or so hoping it would work. finally just before 4:30 the transfer finally went through. On Friday I checked my balance and found that instead of depositing my withdrawal once I had every single attempted withdrawal deposited to my account. I wasn't sure what to do since I now had over 400 extra dollars in my account and a negative balance in my Amazon payments account. I didn't know when the money might be taken out or whether they would only take the extra money or reverse it all and correct it with another deposit. The advice I kept getting was to not touch the money until it was figured out. I felt like I was in limbo and was extremely frustrated. I contacted the seller and told him I wouldn't be able to meet Sunday but if he still had it next weekend I would come get it. After a few days I finally received an email from Amazon confirming the error and that funds would not be removed from anyone's bank account. Unfortunately they weren't clear about what would happen to our Amazon payments account. I confirmed with the seller I would be able to come see the car that weekend and we set a time. One day I found the car was no longer listed and asked if it was sold. The seller replied that he had a flat tire he wasn't able to change and found the car had been towed from the apartment building he parked it at. My heart sank I felt a great opportunity had slipped out of my hands due to bad luck and felt a little bit hopeless about finding a vehicle. Amazon sent an email on Thursday stating the incorrect balance had been resolved and that the extra funds were ours to keep as an apology for the inconvenience I was completely floored that I just got a gift of over $400. A few days later I found a 525i that was listed for only a couple hundred more than the one I was planning to buy and it was a newer model by four years plus the interior looked new and the body was in pretty good condition with no major issues. After checking it over and test driving it I wound up negotiating with the guy for 100 less than the car I was previously going to buy so I wound up with $400 extra dollars and a car that was one model range up and four years newer for less money.,memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

We actually got to the school with 10 minutes to spare, but there was no more parking in the school's lot. We searched around for about 5 minutes and found a spot a couple blocks away.

I thought my fear of falling in the water would make me hate it, but that fear completely went away.

We planned on living there for a bit, saving a bunch of money, and doing other things like travel and a search for long term housing options in the meantime. Well, the option on the families lot fell through with less than a month to move out from our apartment. The next day, a young woman who had recently moved into our complex was having a party outside. 1 of her male friends came to visit and partake in the party. He offered my wife and I a place to park a travel trailer on his lot, for incredibly cheap and also have access to a house. This is where everything started to go downhill.

We have full access to a home, our trailer, and now a yard. I slowly but surely start to see my wife starting to form an emotional affair right before my eyes with the male roommate. We were in a bit of a rough patch, but nothing unworkable in my eyes. She's still disappearing with him in his car, sleeping away from me, becoming extremely distant, indifferent, and all around completely out of her character.

My boss walked into my office like he typically does and it's usually to chat about work related stuff as well as to chat in general about how things are going.

He's been pushing for my promotion for over a year and a half at that point and I had almost given up all hope of this happening any time soon. Evidently, the higher up managers approved the promotion as well as Human Resources. A salary was also approved and my manager informed me of what that new, higher salary would be. I felt relieved that this finally happened and I could stop wondering about my upcoming promotion. At the same time, once my supervisor told me the percentage raise I would receive, I was slightly disappointed. The percentage of my increase equaled the usual annual salary increase I received the past couple of years, even without a promotion. I was unsure if this signified that my past annual increases were abnormally high or if my promotion salary increase was abnormally low. I was hoping for a much bigger raise. Ultimately, my supervisor informed me that there is a cap on how high of an increase an employee can receive in any given year and hopefully there will be more of a raise coming up after my annual review in a couple of months. Given that we had just had my annual review, performance reviews, and all that, I was hopeful that perhaps, even with my recent promotion, I would still qualify for a significant raise when the fiscal year was over. I didn't tell my supervisor about my disappointment with the percentage increase because he was so happy that he was able to get my promotion pushed through after all this time.

I would sit in the back of the car and make animal noises during the entire drive.  Granny Ma would try to guess which animal I was but most of her guesses were always wrong.  When I told her which animal I was, she would tell me how smart I am.  I remember her long curly hair and how we would sit in front of the bathroom mirror as she would brush it out.  She would tell me how important it was to brush slowly in order to keep the hair healthy.  The thing I remembered the most was her smell.  Her home was a like a jasmine garden mixed with warm scents of vanilla and tea.  Everywhere she went left a trail of floral aroma.  It was such a pleasant, comforting smell.  I remember the last time I saw Granny Ma.  Five months ago I was sitting at the foot of the hospital bed.  Granny Ma was covered in tubes, monitors, and wires.  She would lay and smile at me with such soft eyes.  Her hand rested on mine as I would tell her stories of our trips to the zoo, how much I loved her homemade pies, and memories of listening to her play the flute.  I told her about our walks around the community park and how I would light up when I could smell her perfume.  Granny Ma told me how lucky she was to have me in her life and how happy she was to experience it all.  Granny Ma told me that she never had any regrets during her life and wouldn't change a thing.  That night Granny Ma went to sleep forever and the most amazing woman is now blessing Heaven with her heavenly scent.  I still miss her.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
429,"It was 4 months ago, i had my second house get together. It was a game night and i invited friends and family that were my age and a little older. I didn't know what to expect or how they would react, however. The night came and it was a blast. we had so much laughs and fun being together everyone wanted to know when would be the next one.  I felt so happy to have shared that time with my family and friends, when they left i genuinely missed them and could not wait to see them again. it had everything you you would love in a party, food, family, friends and fun. Now that its been so long I'm definitely getting ready to do another with hopes of it turning out even better. For this to turn out the way it did, it did take quiet a bit of planning. I had sent out invitations a month in advance, and the same time i chose the games i wanted to play as well as what we would eat at the party. I decided on us playing a card game with a twist and for food I had pizza, patties, an array of drinks as well as cake. The first person that arrived got a prize. And as we waited for everyone to get there, we sat talked and watch a movie. Everyone showed up somewhat on time and that is when the games began. We ended up playing and laughing it up for a good 3 hours.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

And by we I men grandpa, my pops and I. It was maybe a 3 person canoe. I couldn't be sure, but it was pretty loaded down. The weather was beautiful. Clear with a few big puffy clouds to give some respite from the heat of summer. On the way back to the cabin my grandpa asked me how my classes were going. For the third time. I couldn't believe that it was really happening. Grandpa has Alzheimer's. On the car drive back to the city alone with my father we talked about it. It made us sad since grandpa was doing just fine a year ago.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,

432,"Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,
433,"I start talking to this one girl I met about a year ago. We had been on and off chatting about school, work, life, and other subjects of that nature. At first it wasn't really like I was trying to get with her or anything else. I simply enjoyed talking to her and as we progressed we start opening up more and more. We both attend the same convention every year, so we started planning stuff to do while hanging out. This would not be one on one dates or hangouts but just places in general that we could go with other people we met at the convention. Well the convention was last month and in Texas which is her home state. I got there the Saturday before the con while she got there 3 days later. I had realized around January that I had liked her a lot but didn't want to tell her because I have a fear of rejection and asking her would just make things awkward. So when we went to eat ramen and play mini-golf  with a group of our friends not much happen. At ramen I wasn't able to sit next to her, but at mini-golf we were joking around with each other. Later we all went to the bars and as the night progressed we were holding hands and hugging. Even still I didn't really act on the anything because we were drunk and she could've just been being friendly. Basically the next day we did the same things: ate with a group of people, played games, and went out to the bars. This time however we kissed, so I thought that meant we were in the clear to confess our feelings for each other. The next day I woke up to a ""why did we kiss"" text. I was kind of nervous to answer cause i felt it was a mistake but i told her that I liked her. I was sure she was going to reject me and things would be awkward but instead she said she liked me too and that I should've asked her out earlier. So basically later that day I asked her out officially and we have been dating ever since. I was quite shocked and still am because I have never had a girlfriend before her. All I have gotten are rejections to the point I'm unwilling to ask because I know the answer will be no.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,
434,"My father-in-law passed away a few weeks ago.  He had a heart attack.  My story is going to be about him and the impact he had on my life.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school there.  I moved to California, worked, and met my girlfriend at Stanford.  She had family in Georgia and we eventually moved out here to work and live close to them.  Her family is amazing!  Her father, Craig, has traveled the world as a missionary.  He did a few stints in Indonesia teaching poor people how to setup their village, collect clean water, and rear their children.  I loved this man from the moment I met him.  Selfless and very giving Craig would help everyone.  In fact, during my move to Georgia one of the tires on my car blew out.  I tried to put the spare on but the lug nuts were not coming off.  I was in the middle of nowhere, on the highway, with all of my worldly possessions, pets, and girl and completely stuck.  Well, Craig drove on out probably 150 miles or more, and helped us get going again.  That's the first time I met the man! After living in Georgia for awhile I soon learned that it was NOT anything like California.  Church is big around here.  BIG.  So I got involved with the Church, through Craig, and we started helping put roofs on the houses of widows.  Tough work for sure, but it was extremely rewarding.  I learned so much for the other men helping.  After Craig passed the entire community rallied together.  It was sad of course but amazing.  I am thankful I got to know such a great man and role model.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

I got out of my bed to see what was the problem. He and his friend were in the bathroom. As I walked into the bathroom, I prepared myself for the worst. Blood. There was so much blood in my bathtub. There were drops on the floor, too. I was thankful there wasn't any blood on the carpets in the living room. I was, after all, renting this unit. He tells me he punched his best friend int he nose and he broke it. I was in shock from seeing all of the blood, I didn't know how to react. He had a temper and did not have control over it when he was sober. Seeing the blood, a wave of memories washed over me. When he kept punching my room door to let him inside. He had made a hole into it. When he grabbed my face and shoved me into a wall. When he yelled so much at me, he was spitting. His friend accepted his apology and didn't even get angry and retaliate. He was a terrible friend. A terrible lover as well. I guess he got a good look at himself when he saw my face and all of the blood that he caused to shed. Shortly after, I had to clean the tub.

We thought Las Vegas would be perfect because its close to home and it's a place were we can enjoy ourselves. While being in Vegas we visited many places and enjoyed great company with each other. We stayed about 4 nights in a classy hotel and got room service for the last day of our trip. That day my husband left to go get somethings and told me to get ready on the last day.

The most beautiful part is that i am able to have our children see us get remarried and be a part of our love.  Within the next year we will be having a ceremony and we are so excited.

I would go to sleep some nights, admittedly in tears, because there were certain points in my life where I felt unloved and nobody could possibly fall for me. My best friend, someone who clearly knew how I felt, tried his best to console me. It was hard to admit I was suffering. Little did he know that I had fallen for him a while ago. He just took great care of me and I felt safe when I was around him. One night, my feelings of wanting to confess overran the feelings of wanting to keep it a secret. I blurted it out because there was no good way to share the news. He stood there for a second, seemingly shocked. I had wondered if I just tarnished my friendship.

440,"Dear diary,I haven't written here in a while but with the things that have been happening recently I feel like I need to. As you know I've been staying with my parents and starting to save up money. This was because they told me they plan to move to Texas next year. That's fine, it gives me plenty of time to get caught up, get my finances in order and find a place to move to because I have no intention on moving to Texas with them. That's just too fa away from my current life and I'm not willing to just start over yet. Now here comes the part that just left me angry and jaded for a very long time. About 2 months ago they (and by they I mean my mother and my dad didn't stop her) decided to move the move date up to June 15th. That means my timeline for saving money went from having 8 months and magically dropped down to about a month and a half. Needless to say I was livid. I started to work as much overtime and stay up late hours doing additional work at home because I was in full panic mode and I couldn't afford to not be working around the clock. Now, we get to a few days before June 15th, she's rushing me to get packed and moved out so I disused moving in with one of my friends and he agreed. The 14th we move everything over there and I'm basically done. Still really mad but relieved to have the situation behind me. But it doesn't end there... in all that rushing and we're moving now and you have to go they neglected to tell me something. It turned out that the 15th was NOT when I had to leave. They ended up staying in the house for an entire extra month before they finally moved out and headed to Texas.  I was so mad when one of them said ""No son, we're still here"" I almost hung up the phone immediately. To this day I'm still salty about the whole thing but I've at least gotten over it for the most part. I do miss them a lot and have warmed up to calling them again. Well, sorry I haven't written in a while diary, I'll try to get back to it more often   Ciao!",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

About what a wonderful and caring person that she was. The most surprising thing was a few of mom's friends who showed up who hadn't seen her in many years. It was very touching. It was extremely emotional and alot of tears were shed. It really affirmed just how much people loved and cared about her. But it was good to bond with everyone and exchange some stories about many of the good times that we had spent with her over the years. I was very close to my Mom and miss her quite alot. But I am very thankful for the relationship we had. She was someone I could always talk to about almost anything. Her love and support were unconditional.

It was my first time ever being to the nation's capital, and with one day before my husband's surgery, we attempted to walk all over downtown DC and see as many monuments as possible before we had to be back at Walter Reed and ready for surgery the next morning. We traveled downtown on the Metro, and ended up getting off a short distance from the Capital, where we started. We then saw the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial (my main reason for wanting to go downtown!), the World War 2 Memorial, the Korean Memorial, and Vietnam Memorial. We then took the metro back to Walter Reed, where we were staying on base for the next couple of weeks. Side note, I was really impressed by the strategic placing of water vendors throughout the different monuments, with water, Gatorade, popsicles, etc. I don't know if it's a good use of their life, but we really appreciated them being there! The thing that stood out to me about the monuments was the realization that the Lincoln Memorial literally just had Lincoln's statue in it. I seriously thought that there might be more, maybe a museum commemorating his achievements or something, but it really had just his statue. I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone. What also stuck out to me while we were downtown was the World War 2 Memorial. I honestly didn't expect to be impressed by that memorial. But the different quotes placed around the structure really helped the memorial pop in my mind. I enjoy reading, and reading wisdom from those gone before us, who went through such a horrific time. So, I appreciated that monument more than I expected to.

There were several different disciplines including showmanship, roping, and reigning. In showmanship, the rider walked to horse out into the arena to be judged. While they are being judged, they are asked to do several different tasks. These tasks can be walking, running, backing up, or turning the horse. Whenever a rider is showing their horse, the stay on the opposite side of the judge, so they are not in the way. Roping is when you have the rider behind a locked gate. A person at another gate releases an animal, usually a calf. The rider rides in to throw a rope around the calf's neck. If the rider is successful, they are timed. The times are ranked. The person with the best time wins that round. Next, Reigning is when a rider comes in riding their horse. The horse and rider are challenged with several different tasks, many which consist of spinning. Spinning is making tight circles while going as fast as the rider can. At the end of their presentation, they often run the horse and have then slide into a sitting position. Reigning is a difficult class, but one that is especially fun to watch.

453,"Lifestyle and career are two important, intertwined aspects of everyone's daily lives. A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,

I thought to myself that this is interesting, since no guy had ever bought me a drink before. We ended up talking for hours, and before I knew it I was feeling pretty good. I told myself that I deserved to relax though, and I was safe to drive. On the way home, it all started to hit me. However I only lived 2 miles away and knew that I could make it. Suddenly I saw a bright flash of light, heard screeching, and then nothing. I awoke in the emergency room with a concussion and severely fractured arm. Now, on top of ex problems, I'd have to take time off work. Definitely a lesson learned.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
455,"A week ago my daughter and I were talking about her skateboarding goals. I knew she had been working really hard to improve and I strongly support her with all of it. Her father and I took her to the park to practice. We all know that the only way to get great at skateboarding is to get out there and actually do it. She has some difficult goals but she believes that they will be worth all of the effort and practice once she gets to where she wants to be. I was helping to coach her learning to drop in on a large quarter pipe. Everything looked good but then in just seconds, things did not go as planned. She took a pretty hard fall and it really scared me. It did not take her long to get right back up and get her focus back to where it needed to be. The look on her dad's face went from fear and concern to a genuine look of admiration almost immediately. It turned out to be a great learning experience and we plan to do it again next week. We will most likely be going every week for a while. We live in an area that is warm almost all year. This is a great goal for my daughter for where we live. She knows that we will support her all the way.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
456,"A few months ago, I was in desperate need of some extra income.  The reason, I needed to purchase equipment and a new computer so I can self-teach myself animation and improve on my drawing/sketching ability.  Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to pursue my goals. I had to do something but I was not going to force anything that cost me money or put me debt.  I was bit sad about the situation because like some things in life, people want immediately results.  I needed to be patient, something I have always had an issue with.  However, I was not going to force the issue this time as I had mentioned before. One night out of the blue, a friend and had not hung with for a while wanted to meet up and chat with me about things going in his life and things going on in my life.  My friend picked me up on a Saturday afternoon and we just decided to drive around and talk about life. Because we became hungry after a while, we decided to head to the local casino and eat at the buffet.  You just cannot beat all-you-can-eat for a good price.   Also, I had not been to the casino in years because the last time I went, I cost myself over $100 and vowed not to go again.  However, my friend wanted to go and I did not want to stop him.  After we ate, we decided to sit down and play a couple of slot machine to waste time and test our luck.  As luck would have, I ended up winning about 400 bucks off of just $20 I spent.  My friend did not know I was down to my last 50 before going to the casino, so this money came in hand in a big way.  Now, I am not a religious guy but I will admit I looked up and said thank you to whoever the big man or woman is in the sky.  That money was more than what I needed to get the equipment I needed to purchases as well as purchase a low-cost, online animation course that set me on my way.  I was even able to give my friend $50 just for the hell of it. You just never know when you will be blessed with positive things.  I was so happy that I couldn't contain myself and almost started to cry but held together and just kept a joyful laughter for about a 5 minutes.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,
457,"Dear Diary,I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to write about this, but I've been so busy lately that I haven't had time to write. I'm still amazed at what happened two weeks ago, and have to tell you about it! You know how I did that DNA test a while ago? Well I got the results back, and there was actually a cousin I never knew I had who lived just a mile away in our little senior community! From what I understand, she's a cousin on my father's side, the daughter of his sister. I guess there was some bad blood between her and her parents when she was young, and so she ran away. I'm not sure if my crazy aunt (she really is a piece of work) ever tried to look for her or filed a missing person's report or anything, but this missing cousin ended up right near me after all these years! It took me a few days, Diary, to get up the courage to try to contact her. Finally, I looked her up on the internet and found a number for her. I dialed, said who I was and what the DNA test had revealed, and, surprisingly, she was so thrilled to hear from me! We made a date for coffee at the little shop that's part of our community. When I walked in, I could spot her right away. I could see the family resemblance right away! We must have talked for three hours! Turns out after she left, she got in with a bad crowd, but turned her life around after she got pregnant. She raised her kid the best she could (he turned out great and such a handsome young man!) and worked her way up to head buyer for her company. What's even more amazing is that she's a horror movie fan, just like me! I'm looking forward to hanging out with her more, and to meeting her son as well. Gotta go, Diary. So much work to do, but I wanted to share this with you! Millie",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
458,It was a hot summer day in April. My phone rang and I didn't recognize the number. I don't usually pick up unknown numbers. I decided to pick it up today  because I wasn't that busy. It was my step-father. He wanted to see how I was doing even though we hadn't spoken in several years. Growing up we had a rocky relationship. We never really got along and argued a lot. I felt like he always tried to be my dad and I didn't want him to. Sometimes our arguments turned physical. But now that we were on the phone our conversation was calm. We spoke about my childhood and his relationship with my mother. It was a rough conversation at first but then it got better over time. The conversation was emotional and we caught up for a bit before hanging up. We agreed we would try to stay in tough more often.,memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
459,"I just had the best time at the local zoo! It was a perfect day and it wasn't too crowded but the best part of all was I fed a giraffe for the first time. Actually I spent about an hour and a day's pay feeding giraffes. I couldn't stop, they were so beautiful. I don't know what it was about them, I don't usually like big animals like that but they were so gentle and friendly. I couldn't believe I was standing there face to face with a giraffe. It let me caress it's fuzzy ear antlers or horns or whatever those little nubbins are. I think the most surprising thing was when I felt a long black tongue, smooth like a dog's but not nearly as wet, as I put a leave up to it's mouth. It was like time stood still and nothing else mattered but me and that giraffe! I had fantastical ideas like saddling it and riding away, and wondered if that was even possible. I looked in it's eyes and I felt like we had some sort of cosmic connection. I don't believe in souls but if there were souls I think that giraffe definitely had one! It's really inspired me to work closer with animals. I know I can't train a giraffe like I train the dogs at work but I'd love to work up close with them one day. I will never, ever forget this day. I hope it changes my future.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,
460,"The event that happened to me within the last three to six months that I remember the most is the death of my uncle whom I was very close to. He got very sick with pneumonia, and went to the hospital. When he was in the hospital they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. While he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath.  I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years.  Life goes on, but it certainly will be a lot sadder without him.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

She was the family punching bag. Whenever something went wrong, it was Katie's fault. It didn't matter who did it, how it happened, the fact that Katie was in another state at the time -- the entire family, including her two sisters, would gang up and yell at her. So Katie's sister, Krystal, is getting married into a conservative Greek Orthodox family. She's losing her mind because she wants so bad for her new family to think she's perfect, which is laughable, but whatever. Of course, the morning of the wedding, everything is going wrong and how dare Katie do this, despite the fact that Katie wasn't even awake when everything started happening. Makeup if misplaced, boxes haven't been taken up to the church for decorating, the works. So they all load up and head to the church to get the place ready. Katie grabs a box nearly as big as her hauls it into the church, and asks Krystal where it needs to go, to which she responds, ""OH MY GOD KATIE JUST SET IT DOWN SOMEWHERE!""Katie, being the sweetheart she is, sets it down somewhere out of the way so people won't trip on it, but still in a higher traffic area so it can be found. She goes to put on her dress because some of the groomsmen are putting up the decorations. Of course, Krystal screeches like a banshee not ten minutes later because something in the box Katie had carried in needed refrigeration, but Katie was not informed of that. Not only was it not in the refrigerator, but Katie cleary hid it so nobody else could find it because she was trying to ruin the wedding. Katie apologizes and shows her where the box is. Katie will hold Krystal's bouquet (the other sister couldn't do it for whatever reason -- it was probably too heavy for her poor, dainty arms). So Katie verifies how that's going to work. ""So you give it to me, there's some talking, you and Carl walk around the altar a few times, then I give it back to you?"" Krystal doesn't answer, and after a few more questions, she dismissively says, ""yeah, yeah, you give it back to me.""During the ceremony, Krystal never makes a move to take the bouquet back, and does not accept it when offered. Katie is yelled at about this after the ceremony. Then they get in a huge fight, katie was so angry, she was crying.

462,"My husband is from Australia. He moved to the US in January 2017 after my Australian visa was used up. We did not know what we were going to do, but we figured it out. He got his green card in 2018. It was a hard time as we had little money. Our job situations were not stable and we had a lot of times when we had no money and we were unsure of things. It caused a lot of pressure in our relationship. Last August, we had money saved and we filed for my spouse visa for Australia. It was very expensive and cost about $15,000. We decided that living in Ausralia would be best for us and would make us the most happy. We knew we would be waiting for a long time for the partner visa. There was no word from Australia aside from our confirmation and a cashed check for over 11 months. Last week, after 341 days our visa was granted! We were very surprised and happy!

463,"I felt myself begin to get light headed. I knew this telltale sign immediately. My blood sugar was low. I knew I had to get something in me before it got worse because I could black out. The meal I had in front of me unfortunately was not high enough on sugar to compensate for this. I had to run to the kitchen to see what I could find. Unfortunately, we had no juice in the house at all that I could drink. I went looking for cookies in the cabinets but once again I could not find any. I was starting to panic at this point. There was no one else in the house that could help me if I blacked out. I could seriously die. I finally remembered that I would occasionally keep a candy bar in my bag just for such an occasion. Rushing to the bedroom, I hoped against hope that I had not eaten it already and it was still there. Luckily, it was. I quickly scarfed down the chocolate bar, savoring every bite as best I could. I waited nervously for it to take a hold in my body. I could feel heart rate slowing down. My head began to clear shortly thereafter.

Muscles that weren't cramping up now seizing up because of my more awkward and desperate movements to stay afloat.  Taking on water, choking, vision becoming spotty.  I remember blacking out on the surface, my mind overwhelmed with panic.  But then I remember falling into a comfortable embrace of nothingness.  It was so eternally peaceful.

465,"It was at the time of a restructuring of positions in the company, where I had to be changed from the position of seller of vehicles and heavy machinery. To the stock of spare parts in the company for me it was a very frustrating situation since I had no professional knowledge for the new assignment of work therefore. I was in charge of the position for 6 months but not feeling comfortable I asked for the resignation to locate another job in my outstanding area of work. It was really frustrating for me to be in that situation since I had to financially support my family and also get a new job where both me and my bosses would consider me appropriate and prepared to face the challenges and be able to develop in the area as I was prepared for my job. Previously, in the sales area, therefore, my opportunity was to migrate to another company where I could accommodate my potential and be able to exploit it and in that way continue to stand out and not go through uncomfortable situations within the area where I was working after the dismissal of my colleagues. I am sure that for me and for the company it is more productive for me to start in another company than to continue working in the current one since in addition to not having the necessary knowledge. I have the knowledge and experience in other areas very different from those I am placed by my bosses and due to those decisions I must resign as soon as possible and focus on new goals with new bosses and new company. I think that in life we are always willing to have to make changes but always for the better and that is why I decide the change in the company where I work for more than 12 years and therefore. I am forced to change companies to follow my instincts of great seller and that way continue to assist my clients to whom I owe respect and great value.  I must also give my family the best example of moving forward despite the circumstances and not be discouraged under any circumstances. With that commitment and dedication they will feel appreciated and loved by a family leader who gives all his effort to always locate the better conditions for my family nucleus.  With my new job I feel very moved since I show that when you have some obstacles you decide if you face them or you do not achieve any change and I always decide to overcome them because that has been a large part of my life to overcome obstacles and achieve goals in order to take more satisfactions to my life and my family nucleus. For me and my family, it is satisfying to have achieved my goals at all critical moments in life. The best form to work its your best arm in all the spaces where you need to be guided.

From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring.

She was very brave for her first long car ride in her little car seat and when we got home, we let her free and she just seemed so happy, like she had been meant to be with us all along.  Today has been one of the happiest days as of recent.  I love Gemma so much and I think we're all going to be very happy together.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
478,A few months ago i got in a argument with a friend. We were drinking and he was being mean to me. Ive been picked on by some of my friends over my lifetime. I think he  thought he was joking around but i got really upset. He was making fun of my voice for the way i talk. He was doing it at a bar in front of a group of people. I got mad and challenged him to fight. We have since made up and i told him its ok lets move on. But i really dont want to associate with him any more. Im a grown man and some of my friends from when i was younger im discovering are not good people. Also too much of what of what my old friends always want to do is drink. I struggle moving on because its hard to make new friends. But im realizing im a different person and want to be around different people. While it was just a small fight it kind of led to think about my life and who i want to be around. Ive been hanging out with my family more and more these days.,memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

We had a great time going to my favorite pizza place. I got a large meat lovers. They got a cheese pizza. They paid for the bill. I was very thankful. Later that night, we went to the bar. I sung some karaoke. It was a fun time. I almost threw up from drinking. They helped me get a job. It took a few weeks, but I got a job at a accountant's office. It paid decently with great perks. I loved the workplace. This city is treating me well.",memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
480,"This happen on St. Patrick's Day in March of 2019. I live about 20 minutes away from The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa, FL. The buffet at the casino was having a menu special for the holiday, with a lot of Irish dishes such as shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, and fish and chips. I had planned to take my parents to eat at the buffet since my dad's birthday was coming up. The plan was to go right when they open because it can get pretty busy during these special menu days. My father must have forgotten and had eaten a big breakfast in the morning so he declined to go, and my parents were out of the trip. Not wanting to waste the special menu day, I head over there to partake in the buffet special. The meal was delicious, from eggs benedict to prime rib and then fish and chips and I discovered I'm not a fan of corned beef. The meal was for free, as I was an elite member at the casino since I do gamble regularly. After I was done, I decided to head to the high limit area of the casino. I had won quiet a bit since the beginning of the year, and I had a pretty high bankroll. I start with around 1500 dollars and begin to play. I wasn't really looking to take any risk, but being full from the delicious feast, I decided to entertain myself and gamble a bit. It did not take long to lose all my money. Now I was on full tilt, frustrated with my enormous losses. Instead of walking out, I decided to make a withdraw of another 1500. Down another 500, I decide to try one more machine. After a few spins, I hit the bonus playing at 20 a spin. The bonus game is pretty unique with the multiplier of win line hits goes up after every free game. The thing that happened was when there was a 7x multiplier, I had a line hit for over 7000!! The bonus ended with almost winning 9500 which is my biggest jackpot every. I was very emotional, with shock and disbelief of what occurred. This was a gift, as it helped me pay down a lot of debt. I will forever remember this day, as it changed my life.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,
481,Dear diary. So I know it has been a while since I have written in you but I just wanted to keep you updated. About a month ago I woke up with some pretty bad tooth pain. Most of the morning I was in pain and finnaly ended up calling the doctor about it. They told me I should call my dentist as there was nothing they could do. So I call them and they told me that I had to wait until the next day in order to even see them. I tried taking pain meds and orajel and it did help a little bit but not as much as I hoped. So the next morning came around and I finnaly went there and the told me I needed a root canal! I was pretty nervous that it would hurt quite a bit but I knew in the long run it would be better for my teeth. So after about a 15 minute procedure it was all over. They were nice for the most part but boy did it hurt quite a bit. I would say after about 15 minutes it started to hurt worse but they did give me much better pain pills to deal with it. Later that night I was starting to feel a bit better. When I work up in the morning I was pain free and it was great. Overall I am glad I went and got it done quickly.,memories,2,False,,,,,,,,,
482,"About six weeks ago on my solo motorcycle trip to Canada I had a truly unforgettable experience while camping for the night. I was alone in a remote area of northern Wyoming and heard a terrifying sound at about 3AM.  I had intended to camp at a developed site next to a lake because it was bear country and there were bear-proof storage boxes at the campsites.  When I arrived at the lake I was disappointed in the area, there was nobody there (it was a weekday) but it was obviously heavily used and a bit dumpy.  I decided to ride further down the dirt road to see what else there might be.  I came across a trail and after a mile or so there was a small clearing in the trees.  I thought that it would make a suitable site to set up the tent.  It was a bit eerie - there were forest fires in the region and the sky was reddish from the smoke, there was also Spanish moss hanging from the tree branches which added to the creepy atmosphere.  At any rate, I made dinner, enjoyed a beer and went to sleep at about 11PM.  I was awakened by a piercing scream at around 3AM, it was absolutely terrifying and I had never heard anything like it before.  All that came to mind at the time was that there was a large bird like a eagle outside the tent screeching at something.  As I listened I could hear it walking around the tent about 100' away, there were small branches breaking under it's feet as it walked along... whatever it was it seemed pretty big.  I was too scared to open the zipper and look outside the tent, I didn't want to draw attention to myself and have to deal with this thing up close.  After over an hour the sounds became more and more faint and I eventually drifted to sleep.  In the morning I examined the ground where I had imagined it had been walking.  I found some very clear large paw prints - it was a mountain lion!  I have never seen a mountain lion in the wild, and the sound that it was making that night was otherworldly, something I'll never forget.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,
483,"Dear Diary, On my birthday this year I turned 54 years old and reached the nine year anniversary of a dreadful time that forever changed my life. To celebrate and mark the occasion my grown son took me to Walt Disney World for a week long vacation. I had never been to Disney World and, being a lifetime fan of Disneyland, having the chance to experience this park with my son was a dream come true. I had become very ill nine years ago and nearly lost my life to liver and heart failure. The illness came out of the blue and remains an unknown etiology as far as my physician is concerned. My recovery and transformation has been time consuming and come with many changes to my life, abilities, and career. My son walked along my side during my illness and knew that reaching a point where I could travel with him would be the best reward I could hope for. Our vacation was amazing from the moment we reached Florida and boarded the Disney bus. Our resort hotel was absolutely beautiful and the parks were amazing. Animal Kingdom was by far our favorite resort with Epcot a close second. My son had been very careful to book all of our dining reservations with my needs in mind. A chef came to our table to ask me about my dietary restrictions and made beautiful meals for me. We even had a refrigerator and microwave in our room so I could prepare my own breakfast each day. We both agreed that Disneyland still outshines any theme park and will be our family favorite. I rarely spend long periods of time with my son since he is 32, very busy in his career, and travels the world for business. Having this week with him, building memories, and sharing new experiences is a time I will always treasure.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

We told him to inviate all the freinds from class if he wanted and anybody else that he had in mind.

I believe she got mixed up, went to the wrong apartment or was just simply mistaken. I'm the type that would have answered the door, but explained there were other things I needed to do. I certainly wouldn't have just not opened the door. Everyone in my family mentioned that to her. She was very stubborn and always thought she was a bit better than everyone else morally.  I did apologize just because my mother asked me to. It was easier to do that than let my mom be upset. But, it was never the same with us.

As I had planned, I quit my job and used the funds I had slowly saved over the years to buy my first home to spruce up and flip for all that easy money. Well, that was the plan at least. The reality shows, infomercials and seminars all make it out to be so much easier than it actually is. I should have known better, but I was just too excited for the life change I always dreamed of. To be fair, purchasing the first home was easy... too easy. I should have seen the warning flags, but nope, excitement clouded my judgement.

No matter how cautious you are there‚Äôs always someone out there on the complete other side of the spectrum. It was about three months ago when this finally proved true for me. I was going about my daily business like any other day. I was driving to the grocery store to pick up some pasta sauce and Italian bread to make for dinner that night. I was taking my usual road. I stopped at the red light and waited for it to turn green. Once it did, I inched forward before driving through the intersection. Almost instantly it felt like I had been shot. The sound was deafening as a pickup truck came crashing into the passenger side of my car, causing me to spin around and around. I wasn‚Äôt sure what going on, and I thought that maybe I was actually dying. Once the spinning and the ringing in my ears stopped, I opened my eyes and moved around a bit. I was okay somehow. I got out of my car to examine the damage done. My car was not so lucky. The entire passenger side of it was completely caved in and the wheel had come clean off. Apparently, the driver of the pickup truck was texting on his phone and was completely oblivious to his light turning red. He sped right through the light and blind-sided me.

With each loss I lost myself a little more, and felt defeated, almost like I had done something wrong somewhere in my life to deserve some of the worst pain a person could ever experience. Our last loss was a third trimester loss, two days before my due date. Everything looked great through the pregnancy and I thought ""this is it, finally! we made it to the end safely"", until those dreams were shattered just as quickly as they pregnancy progressed. We discovered at a routine non stress test that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed from a cord accident. Even though each loss prior to this had been difficult, this was the worst.

Compared to everything else that I tried, this one by far sounded the best. The guy at the store was named Bob, and he was very friendly. I appreciated that he wasn't too pushy.

499,"Dear Diary,I spoke to Grandma today or at least I tried to. I will admit that I don't go to visit her nearly as much as I should in the nursing home but to be honest it really just breaks my heart to do so. She seems so miserable and she looks so unhealthy. She's lost so much weight and her hair has gotten so white and thin. It's hard to look at this sickly and frail old woman and try to equate her with the strong and sweet woman that I grew up with. Living over an hour away most of our conversations have had to be over the phone and maybe that's just better for us both. Sometimes when I do visit she cries a lot and I feel so awful because there's nothing I can do to alleviate her sadness and pain. I was working from home today and my mom called to tell me that she was visiting Nana and that Nana wanted to talk to me. I've always been a really literal person so I pay a lot of attention not only to what people say but how they say it. She didn't say that she wanted me to talk to Nana, but that Nana wanted to talk to me. Which meant that she asked my mom to contact me. I know this might not seem like a big deal to most people, but it really was a huge deal to me because Nana has had a series of strokes over the past few years and her speech never truly recovered from the last one. Communicating is extremely frustrating for her as well as us. So that means that she was able to communicate well enough that my mother was able to understand what she wanted her to do. So, I told my mom to go ahead and put her on the phone. As soon as I heard her voice filter through the headset, I greeted her warmly and asked if the hospital staff was treating her well. She started trying to say something and was stammering really badly. Knowing that this is the point in which she usually gets frustrated and gives up, I encouraged her to think very carefully about what she wanted to say and try again. We went through that for several minutes before she could finally get out the words that ""She had me on her mind and she just wanted to tell me that she loved me."" The rest of our conversation was pretty much me guessing what she was trying to convey and her either confirming or denying that my guess was right. I remain astounded that those words were completely clear and everything else she said was gibberish. It was as if she had said the most important thing and was ok with everything else being muddled.",memories,2,True,,,,,,,,,

There were so many different decorations that were all so new to me because I had never been to Hawaii. All the different colorful flowers, the gorgeous hula girls and their colorful outfits, everything was perfect. The only sad part is that a lot of family and friends could not make it because it was so far and expensive to travel there. But, when we least expected it, our friends from back home showed up which was a huge surprise. It was actually surprising of them because they usually do not like to spend money on traveling for less than a week but they made it out. I think they purposely told us they could not make it so they can surprise us. My friends, my sister's friends, and her finance's friends were all there. I was so happy that their best friends showed up for them. But, not to be selfish, I was also happy that I would be able to spend the last day after the wedding in Hawaii with all of my friends.

702,"You would think my graduation at Harvard three weeks ago harbored for me only feelings of joy and excitement. And while this may be true, These feelings were mixed with those of regret and fear. Fear of the unknown in the new chapter of my life I was about to enter, the workforce. This is why we work so hard to get into Harvard , right? Still, there's always that anxiety when welcoming drastic change in life, and this may be the most drastic change of mine. I only wish I could have gotten to know my fellow classmates better. I'll never know, but I feel like there were lifelong friendships that could have been had if I put myself out there. And as I was on that stage I'll never forget how excited I saw all my peers, i'm sure each story they had to tell was just as exciting. I won't give the excuse of how busy I so frequently was, or how my involvement with band made things that much more unlikely. Speaking of band, I've had so many good and bad stories to tell. My most memorable would have to be while performing at a tournament. One of the band teams was so off their own instructor quit mid performance! I felt sorry for that group, it was so embarrassing to watch. We on the other hand got second place among stiff competition. That speaks to how close we are as a group and how in sync we were. When I was in band I never felt out of place, quite the opposite. So as I looked again at that stage and see everyone whose name was called I can't help but wonder, could I have formed just as strong a connection to he and she. I guess I'll never know, what I was sure of though was the next chapter in my life I would make the most of it.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
703,"Two months ago I was surprised to receive an offer of employment from my former organization. It was unexpected but I thought this reflected well on my past performance as an employee. It appears that the organization is going through a restructure and my former employer thought my input and guidance would be useful during this challenging period. My former manager, who asked me to return as manager of a newly forming team, said he believed I would be a great asset in bringing old and new employees together to help drive the organization forward. He also said my old team had been affected by my retirement and their productivity was not quite as good as it had been under my leadership. Admittedly, I do miss my former colleagues and team but I do not miss the pressure of my former position and having new and harder targets to achieve on a regular basis - not only was it hard for me but even harder leading others to achieve. My former industry is becoming more and more competitive as new technologies are released and more talented people are attracted into the area. My former manager also offered me a significant pay rise and good bonus potential. I was very tempted by this offer especially as my 401k and social security could use the boost! That said there are many aspects of the job I don't want to repeat even with the temptation of potentially new ways of doing things. I was happy to retire as I was getting very tired and stressed by the demands of the organization and industry. I do not think I have the energy and ambition to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of the job. Still, the offer had me torn and I asked for a week to think things over. My former manager said that would be fine and he hoped I would return. During that week I called some former colleagues to find out what had been going on within the organization since I had retired. They all agreed, separately, that the industry has indeed become much more competitive and the organization was struggling to keep up, hence the restructure. Most commented that it had been and still was a difficult and stressful time. Some said they envied my retirement and wished they could do the same! The things my colleagues said helped me make up my mind to turn down the offer. I enjoy being retired too much to return to a highly stressful job. I love being able to spend much more time with my grandchildren and money isn't too tight. I don't have expensive tastes any way. I also enjoy spending time on my hobbies and not having to get up every morning at the same time.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,

Fruit salad was also prepared, one of the kids favorites. I had made lemon nut cookies so those too were added to the pile. The pile also included whatever else was in the kitchen that made for good snacking. We headed to THE BIGGEST PLAYGROUND IN THE CITY. It turned out to be a beautiful, interesting spot . Giant hills were the background to a tall tall playground  and nearby splash pad. The grey, blue, and yellow playground  was a three story tower to triumph. Children ran everywhere, enjoying the unique play, climb, and swing structures. The most memorable thing it had was a small zip line that was a come first situation. Waiting in line was worth it. Our whole family got to play on it for awhile. We laughed and zipped and picnicked.  We climbed the giant hills and checked the view. A beautiful day.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

706,"So I am usually a people pleaser.  I also hate to be the cause of conflict. So here I am, at work, feeling queasy from morning sickness (I‚Äôm 8 weeks)And I get a message from DH‚Äôs Aunt. She asks me if I had anything planned for my birthday which is in about 3 weeks. I figure she‚Äôs just organising her families calendar, so I say ‚Äúnothing as of yet, when I do it might just be low key pizzas at our house‚Äù (We are actually organising something so we can announce we are pregnant to his family!)And she writes a spiel about her MLM (I forgot she was involved in) and how she can host a party for me and my friends and it will be loads of fun and we will get loads of freebies and blah blah blah. And I instantly get a cold sweat, I wonder how I can explain to her that I‚Äôm fundamentally against supporting MLMs without pissing her off, if it‚Äôs less hassle to just let her throw one, while also being irritated that she would even ask.  Every invite I‚Äôve received from her so far on FB, I‚Äôve just ignored, hoping she wouldn‚Äôt notice me among all the other women she invited. Then the hormone monster took over for a second, and I  wrote ‚ÄúNo, thank you‚Äù and hit send. And she wrote back ‚ÄúOh, OK‚Äù And that‚Äôs it!

My original instinct was not to ‚Äúgo on a rant‚Äù, it was the feeling of needing to justify my response, and the stress of trying to figure out how to justify my lack of wanting to be involved, without hurting any feelings. I did not say that MLM people are crazy monsters.  I do think the MLM business model is unethical and I hate having friends and family trying to sell me things.  But that wasn‚Äôt my point of posting. My point was that I was trying to come up with a good excuse or response and was feeling stressed about it, when all I needed to say was ‚Äúno‚Äù.  I‚Äôm very bad at doing that, and it felt good to do so.  I did the same thing throughout my wedding, so I thought I‚Äôd share as a reminder that it‚Äôs okay to say no.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
707,"4 months ago, I was dating a guy named Brian DeFranco. At first I thought he was everything that I always wanted in a man. Not only did he work a full time job but he also helped around the house, treated me and my daughter like royalty, and was faithful. He had mentioned numerous times throughout our relationship that he had a rough past, but never did either of us imagine that it would catch up to him like it did in the most embarrassing way possible. One weekend, me, Brian, and my daughter Diamond were all eating breakfast when suddenly there was a loud banging on the door. ""Open up this is the police!"" a man cried.This startled me, but Brian seemed unfazed as he quickly and quietly got up from the table and started to make his way towards the bedroom. I asked him where he was going but he wouldn't tell me. All he said was to act like he had been missing for days to save myself. I watched in horror as opened the window and climbed out without uttering another word as the police continued to knock. ""Hold on, I'm coming!"" I said, closing the window and leaving the bedroom to walk to the main door. My daughter was in tears. ""Where did Brian go?"" she wailed. I shushed her, composed myself, and opened the door. As soon as I did, five police officers swarmed in and they went about raiding my entire apartment. ""Excuse me. What is going on?"" I said. One of the police officers told me that they were looking for my boyfriend as apparently he had murdered his father. I did my best to remain calm. ""He asked if I had seen him around lately. I lied and told him no and that it had been a few days. ""He's not here so please leave, you all are scaring my daughter."" After they'd finished searching, the police all gathered around in my living room. They asked me more questions about Brian and then they left, saying that they'd let me know when they found him. I remember crying for hours after the'd left and wondering things went so wrong so fast? Days later, I received a call that they did find Brian in another state and he was in police custody. He's now sitting in jail where he'll remain for 30 years without parole for manslaughter of his father William DeFranco.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
708,I never thought about math as something to struggle with. Numbers came easily to me and so did math. When I was asked to TA a class over the summer I was a bit apprehensive because I didnt know what I was supposed to really help with. The professor teaching the class really struggled with explaining things in a meaningful way. Those that took an interest in learning came to me and loved my explanations. I was told 3 weeks ago by the school that they had gotten many glowing positive comments from the students. They were very appreciative of how i listened to them and helped them. it really made me feel good about how I teach and what i could do to help. I am considering doing another course in the fall provided I can get the job back. I also considered getting an adjunct job after graduating with my masters. Sometimes its a matter of taking the time to listen to the needs of others. It was humbling to be involved in such an impactful way. I will always remember the kind comments I got. I hope others can learn from me and share what I shared. Overall this was a very positive experience.,memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,

We were so close, we even moved into the same house together. As soon as I got a boyfriend after college, we started to fade away from each other's lives. I wish that we had kept in contact, but people drift away. I was shocked when my now husband asked me ""Didn't you know Janet?"" and I said ""Man, Janet! Yes! Why?"" and he told me that she had passed away. I was shocked! I went to her funeral and talked to old friends of ours. They started talking about how we all went for coffee and donuts before it became a huge fad with teens. After the funeral, I went to Dunkin Donuts and got a dozen donuts and a large coffee. I sat in the parking lot eating and crying. I wish I could say that that was the only time I did that. It wasn't. I did this every week for months. Sometimes, when I got really sad, I'd do it multiple times. In 3 months, I gained 25 pounds. I knew I had to get a hold of myself.

Luckily both my parents were home at the time and called 911. The ambulance came out picked me up to take me to the hospital, although I was told I had kind of regained consciousness before they arrived. I work up in the hospital to my whole family being there, at least that is what they told me as my memory of the day is hazy, which was nice. It was the since I was liked 4 years old that I had ever been in a hospital. I basically just sat on a bed while they ran tests on me. Luckily nothing was bad at all, I had no broken bones or trauma or anything. I did have to stay overnight in the hospital just so they could evaluate me to me fully sure I was fine since I was still very lightheaded. My family left to go home, although my mother did stay overnight at the hospital with me since she insisted. I got discharged in the morning and came home. I then spend the next two weeks recovering as I had to let my head recover. My memory was also not very good during that time but everything is back to normal now. My brother took a picture of me when I was out of it on the hospital bed. It is funny to look back at now, although I still basically have a fuzzy memory regarding the events of the day. This was the first time in my life I have had to deal with a serious injury, as before this the worst thing to happened to me was just stuff like stubbing my toe. It was also my first time having to deal with hospital bills in the aftermath, that was a lot of fun. Luckily, I had insurance so it was not as bad as it could have been.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

We had put so many candles on the birthday cake that the flames started to merge into one. The birthday person had to blow out the candles quickly, otherwise the flames might have reached the cake! It took a while for them to blow out all the candles. But after that we sang happy birthday and enjoyed the celebration. We enjoyed eating the cake and talking about things at the party.

The police investigated the incident and managed to find two suspects that seemed to fit the events of what happened. It seems that the suspects were also accused of murdering a 17 year old girl in the same fashion about a couple of months before this one. Everyone was at ease learning that the perpetrators have been caught. However, a few months after the incident, the suspects were released. The police did not mention why or if they had any additional leads on the situation. To say the least, our community was up in arms about it. There were complaints to the police department, detective in charge and even to the mayor! It was all very confusing. Not only that, the released suspects weren't even charged in the previous incident before this one. We are all still in a state of shock over it. We are not sure what we are going to do.

You know that feeling you get when something just isn't right. You can't really explain it, but there's just something not right about things. I weird omen perhaps. Whatever it was, I knew it had to be important, so I answered the phone. The all was from an old college friend of mine who I hadn't seen in over 10 years. Ginny's voice sounded very strange, a bit shaky, not like the person I knew in college. The last time I talked to her, she had just been through a very serious round of chemotherapy, but was taking it like a champ and was in full remission. Why was she calling me, I wondered, but knew the answer. Her cancer had returned and was in full force now. I listened to my friend talk, and tried to encourage her as she fought back the tears.

717,I was looking to buy a car but I didn't have transportation at the time so my options were limited. I finally found a BMW 328i close enough to ride my bike to see. I contacted the seller and made plans to see it that Sunday. I had been withdrawing cash every week to be sure I had enough to buy a car when I found one but I needed enough money in my bank account to cover the cost of insurance so I'd be able to drive it home. On Thursday I made certain to transfer the funds I needed well before the cutoff time. A little while later I got an email that the transfer failed. I found a reddit thread stating others were having the same problem. The withdrawal had to be done before about 5:00 or I knew it wouldn't be in my account. I tried throughout the day every 30 to 45 minutes or so hoping it would work. finally just before 4:30 the transfer finally went through. On Friday I checked my balance and found that instead of depositing my withdrawal once I had every single attempted withdrawal deposited to my account. I wasn't sure what to do since I now had over 400 extra dollars in my account and a negative balance in my Amazon payments account. I didn't know when the money might be taken out or whether they would only take the extra money or reverse it all and correct it with another deposit. The advice I kept getting was to not touch the money until it was figured out. I felt like I was in limbo and was extremely frustrated. I contacted the seller and told him I wouldn't be able to meet Sunday but if he still had it next weekend I would come get it. After a few days I finally received an email from Amazon confirming the error and that funds would not be removed from anyone's bank account. Unfortunately they weren't clear about what would happen to our Amazon payments account. I confirmed with the seller I would be able to come see the car that weekend and we set a time. One day I found the car was no longer listed and asked if it was sold. The seller replied that he had a flat tire he wasn't able to change and found the car had been towed from the apartment building he parked it at. My heart sank I felt a great opportunity had slipped out of my hands due to bad luck and felt a little bit hopeless about finding a vehicle. Amazon sent an email on Thursday stating the incorrect balance had been resolved and that the extra funds were ours to keep as an apology for the inconvenience I was completely floored that I just got a gift of over $400. A few days later I found a 525i that was listed for only a couple hundred more than the one I was planning to buy and it was a newer model by four years plus the interior looked new and the body was in pretty good condition with no major issues. After checking it over and test driving it I wound up negotiating with the guy for 100 less than the car I was previously going to buy so I wound up with $400 extra dollars and a car that was one model range up and four years newer for less money.,memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

I thought my fear of falling in the water would make me hate it, but that fear completely went away.

We had an extremely small place we were going to move into on some families lot just to hold us over. We planned on living there for a bit, saving a bunch of money, and doing other things like travel and a search for long term housing options in the meantime. Well, the option on the families lot fell through with less than a month to move out from our apartment.

He offered my wife and I a place to park a travel trailer on his lot, for incredibly cheap and also have access to a house. This is where everything started to go downhill.

So, it's the end of April, our lease is up April 31st, and we're finally moving out after purchasing a travel trailer. We end up on the lot, it's in a very seedy neighborhood, but it's nice enough. We have full access to a home, our trailer, and now a yard. I slowly but surely start to see my wife starting to form an emotional affair right before my eyes with the male roommate. We were in a bit of a rough patch, but nothing unworkable in my eyes. She's still disappearing with him in his car, sleeping away from me, becoming extremely distant, indifferent, and all around completely out of her character. To cut the story short as it honestly is deeply upsetting me, June 2nd rolls around and as she's getting out of the shower after avoiding me like a plague, she tells me she no longer wants to try in our relationship. 8.5 years treated like a tissue that can just be thrown away. The betrayal I have felt since then has been unimaginable. Our court date is set for dissolution and my heart hurts every second of every day.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
726,"4 months ago was the most memorable day of my life! It was the most perfect day, my wedding day. I couldn't have enjoyed it more. It started with a perfect sunshine among billowing clouds, without any threat of rain. All of my close family was there. I had an amazing hair dresser that made me feel like a princess. She made me look like a princess too! I did have a nervous moment walking down the isle with all those eyes looking at me. However, my dad was there to hold me up. I watched my future husband wipe a tear from his eye as I walked down the isle. I saw many smiles and nods of admiration as I passed each pew. We made our promises to each other. And my husband kissed me with the most beautiful and memorable kiss to be had. I felt so beautiful as he looked deeply in my eyes.I felt cherished as he held my face in his hands. That kiss took me to another world! We then walked into the sunshine and cheers of our family and friends. They celebrated us and threw confetti. Our car was decorated with streamers as we drove off to the reception. Every meal was perfect. Our friends had such beautiful words for us, as they raised a glass to toast us. We danced the night away with each other, and all who came to celebrate. Even my great -grandmother danced with us! I hold all of these things close in my heart. This is just the beginning of our life together. I hope that it sets the scene for many memories to come.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
727,"It started off like a regular day at work when I walked in that morning. My boss walked into my office like he typically does and it's usually to chat about work related stuff as well as to chat in general about how things are going. This time, he started off chatting about normal, routine work stuff and then casually threw in that my promotion was finally approved and about to go into effect. He's been pushing for my promotion for over a year and a half at that point and I had almost given up all hope of this happening any time soon. Evidently, the higher up managers approved the promotion as well as Human Resources. A salary was also approved and my manager informed me of what that new, higher salary would be. I felt relieved that this finally happened and I could stop wondering about my upcoming promotion. At the same time, once my supervisor told me the percentage raise I would receive, I was slightly disappointed. The percentage of my increase equaled the usual annual salary increase I received the past couple of years, even without a promotion. I was unsure if this signified that my past annual increases were abnormally high or if my promotion salary increase was abnormally low. I was hoping for a much bigger raise. Ultimately, my supervisor informed me that there is a cap on how high of an increase an employee can receive in any given year and hopefully there will be more of a raise coming up after my annual review in a couple of months. Given that we had just had my annual review, performance reviews, and all that, I was hopeful that perhaps, even with my recent promotion, I would still qualify for a significant raise when the fiscal year was over. I didn't tell my supervisor about my disappointment with the percentage increase because he was so happy that he was able to get my promotion pushed through after all this time. I didn't want to deflate him or make him feel that his efforts were unappreciated.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
728,"It's been 5 months since I lost her but I still think about Granny Ma every day.  I remember when I was a child, Granny Ma would take me to the zoo.  I would sit in the back of the car and make animal noises during the entire drive.  Granny Ma would try to guess which animal I was but most of her guesses were always wrong.  When I told her which animal I was, she would tell me how smart I am.  I remember her long curly hair and how we would sit in front of the bathroom mirror as she would brush it out.  She would tell me how important it was to brush slowly in order to keep the hair healthy.  The thing I remembered the most was her smell.  Her home was a like a jasmine garden mixed with warm scents of vanilla and tea.  Everywhere she went left a trail of floral aroma.  It was such a pleasant, comforting smell.  I remember the last time I saw Granny Ma.  Five months ago I was sitting at the foot of the hospital bed.  Granny Ma was covered in tubes, monitors, and wires.  She would lay and smile at me with such soft eyes.  Her hand rested on mine as I would tell her stories of our trips to the zoo, how much I loved her homemade pies, and memories of listening to her play the flute.  I told her about our walks around the community park and how I would light up when I could smell her perfume.  Granny Ma told me how lucky she was to have me in her life and how happy she was to experience it all.  Granny Ma told me that she never had any regrets during her life and wouldn't change a thing.  That night Granny Ma went to sleep forever and the most amazing woman is now blessing Heaven with her heavenly scent.  I still miss her.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,

I didn't know what to expect or how they would react, however. The night came and it was a blast. we had so much laughs and fun being together everyone wanted to know when would be the next one.  I felt so happy to have shared that time with my family and friends, when they left i genuinely missed them and could not wait to see them again. it had everything you you would love in a party, food, family, friends and fun. Now that its been so long I'm definitely getting ready to do another with hopes of it turning out even better. For this to turn out the way it did, it did take quiet a bit of planning. I had sent out invitations a month in advance, and the same time i chose the games i wanted to play as well as what we would eat at the party. I decided on us playing a card game with a twist and for food I had pizza, patties, an array of drinks as well as cake. The first person that arrived got a prize. And as we waited for everyone to get there, we sat talked and watch a movie. Everyone showed up somewhat on time and that is when the games began. We ended up playing and laughing it up for a good 3 hours.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

732,"Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
733,"I start talking to this one girl I met about a year ago. We had been on and off chatting about school, work, life, and other subjects of that nature. At first it wasn't really like I was trying to get with her or anything else. I simply enjoyed talking to her and as we progressed we start opening up more and more. We both attend the same convention every year, so we started planning stuff to do while hanging out. This would not be one on one dates or hangouts but just places in general that we could go with other people we met at the convention. Well the convention was last month and in Texas which is her home state. I got there the Saturday before the con while she got there 3 days later. I had realized around January that I had liked her a lot but didn't want to tell her because I have a fear of rejection and asking her would just make things awkward. So when we went to eat ramen and play mini-golf  with a group of our friends not much happen. At ramen I wasn't able to sit next to her, but at mini-golf we were joking around with each other. Later we all went to the bars and as the night progressed we were holding hands and hugging. Even still I didn't really act on the anything because we were drunk and she could've just been being friendly. Basically the next day we did the same things: ate with a group of people, played games, and went out to the bars. This time however we kissed, so I thought that meant we were in the clear to confess our feelings for each other. The next day I woke up to a ""why did we kiss"" text. I was kind of nervous to answer cause i felt it was a mistake but i told her that I liked her. I was sure she was going to reject me and things would be awkward but instead she said she liked me too and that I should've asked her out earlier. So basically later that day I asked her out officially and we have been dating ever since. I was quite shocked and still am because I have never had a girlfriend before her. All I have gotten are rejections to the point I'm unwilling to ask because I know the answer will be no.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
734,"My father-in-law passed away a few weeks ago.  He had a heart attack.  My story is going to be about him and the impact he had on my life.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school there.  I moved to California, worked, and met my girlfriend at Stanford.  She had family in Georgia and we eventually moved out here to work and live close to them.  Her family is amazing!  Her father, Craig, has traveled the world as a missionary.  He did a few stints in Indonesia teaching poor people how to setup their village, collect clean water, and rear their children.  I loved this man from the moment I met him.  Selfless and very giving Craig would help everyone.  In fact, during my move to Georgia one of the tires on my car blew out.  I tried to put the spare on but the lug nuts were not coming off.  I was in the middle of nowhere, on the highway, with all of my worldly possessions, pets, and girl and completely stuck.  Well, Craig drove on out probably 150 miles or more, and helped us get going again.  That's the first time I met the man! After living in Georgia for awhile I soon learned that it was NOT anything like California.  Church is big around here.  BIG.  So I got involved with the Church, through Craig, and we started helping put roofs on the houses of widows.  Tough work for sure, but it was extremely rewarding.  I learned so much for the other men helping.  After Craig passed the entire community rallied together.  It was sad of course but amazing.  I am thankful I got to know such a great man and role model.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

I got out of my bed to see what was the problem. He and his friend were in the bathroom. As I walked into the bathroom, I prepared myself for the worst. Blood. There was so much blood in my bathtub. There were drops on the floor, too. I was thankful there wasn't any blood on the carpets in the living room. I was, after all, renting this unit. He tells me he punched his best friend int he nose and he broke it. I was in shock from seeing all of the blood, I didn't know how to react. He had a temper and did not have control over it when he was sober. Seeing the blood, a wave of memories washed over me. When he kept punching my room door to let him inside. He had made a hole into it. When he grabbed my face and shoved me into a wall. When he yelled so much at me, he was spitting. His friend accepted his apology and didn't even get angry and retaliate. He was a terrible friend. A terrible lover as well. I guess he got a good look at himself when he saw my face and all of the blood that he caused to shed. Shortly after, I had to clean the tub.

I would go to sleep some nights, admittedly in tears, because there were certain points in my life where I felt unloved and nobody could possibly fall for me. My best friend, someone who clearly knew how I felt, tried his best to console me. It was hard to admit I was suffering. Little did he know that I had fallen for him a while ago. He just took great care of me and I felt safe when I was around him. One night, my feelings of wanting to confess overran the feelings of wanting to keep it a secret. I blurted it out because there was no good way to share the news. He stood there for a second, seemingly shocked. I had wondered if I just tarnished my friendship.

740,"Dear diary,I haven't written here in a while but with the things that have been happening recently I feel like I need to. As you know I've been staying with my parents and starting to save up money. This was because they told me they plan to move to Texas next year. That's fine, it gives me plenty of time to get caught up, get my finances in order and find a place to move to because I have no intention on moving to Texas with them. That's just too fa away from my current life and I'm not willing to just start over yet. Now here comes the part that just left me angry and jaded for a very long time. About 2 months ago they (and by they I mean my mother and my dad didn't stop her) decided to move the move date up to June 15th. That means my timeline for saving money went from having 8 months and magically dropped down to about a month and a half. Needless to say I was livid. I started to work as much overtime and stay up late hours doing additional work at home because I was in full panic mode and I couldn't afford to not be working around the clock. Now, we get to a few days before June 15th, she's rushing me to get packed and moved out so I disused moving in with one of my friends and he agreed. The 14th we move everything over there and I'm basically done. Still really mad but relieved to have the situation behind me. But it doesn't end there... in all that rushing and we're moving now and you have to go they neglected to tell me something. It turned out that the 15th was NOT when I had to leave. They ended up staying in the house for an entire extra month before they finally moved out and headed to Texas.  I was so mad when one of them said ""No son, we're still here"" I almost hung up the phone immediately. To this day I'm still salty about the whole thing but I've at least gotten over it for the most part. I do miss them a lot and have warmed up to calling them again. Well, sorry I haven't written in a while diary, I'll try to get back to it more often   Ciao!",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

Side note, I was really impressed by the strategic placing of water vendors throughout the different monuments, with water, Gatorade, popsicles, etc. I don't know if it's a good use of their life, but we really appreciated them being there! The thing that stood out to me about the monuments was the realization that the Lincoln Memorial literally just had Lincoln's statue in it. I seriously thought that there might be more, maybe a museum commemorating his achievements or something, but it really had just his statue. I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone. What also stuck out to me while we were downtown was the World War 2 Memorial. I honestly didn't expect to be impressed by that memorial. But the different quotes placed around the structure really helped the memorial pop in my mind. I enjoy reading, and reading wisdom from those gone before us, who went through such a horrific time. So, I appreciated that monument more than I expected to. I'm really glad I was able to get the chance to see a small part of our Capital even though our reason for being there wasn't necessarily ideal.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
751,"I recently went to a American Quarter Horse Show in Camden, South Carolina. The show took place the middle of April. While at the show, we watched several extremely talented riders. There were several different disciplines including showmanship, roping, and reigning. In showmanship, the rider walked to horse out into the arena to be judged. While they are being judged, they are asked to do several different tasks. These tasks can be walking, running, backing up, or turning the horse. Whenever a rider is showing their horse, the stay on the opposite side of the judge, so they are not in the way. Roping is when you have the rider behind a locked gate. A person at another gate releases an animal, usually a calf. The rider rides in to throw a rope around the calf's neck. If the rider is successful, they are timed. The times are ranked. The person with the best time wins that round. Next, Reigning is when a rider comes in riding their horse. The horse and rider are challenged with several different tasks, many which consist of spinning. Spinning is making tight circles while going as fast as the rider can. At the end of their presentation, they often run the horse and have then slide into a sitting position. Reigning is a difficult class, but one that is especially fun to watch. If you ever have the chance to attend an American Quarter Horse Show, you will not regret it.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
752,"Two weeks ago I had a hysterectomy. It was very emotional for me, as being a woman anyone would understand. But I know the result from having it done was much better for me. It's so much better for my health because of the diseases I had. I won't suffer anymore as I used to. The surgery itself was tough, but after recovery I will feel much better. I'm sad in some ways that this ended up happening, but I'm glad I found a doctor who was able to help me. Life can still go on and I will bounce back from this. I am grateful I was able to finally come to a resolution with my health and move on. I can look forward to being out of pain and suffering now. In the long run, quality of life is what is most important so I can enjoy my days. I know this won't make me any less of a woman. I've always been scared of surgery, but I got through it! I am a strong woman. This is just another reminder of my strength.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
753,"Lifestyle and career are two important, intertwined aspects of everyone's daily lives. A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
754,"It started out as an innocent-enough day. I went to work like normal, and got through most of the day without any abnormal occurences. Then I received a text from my ex, and my mood instantly went downhill. It had been an abusive relationship, and scary breakup. I thought I had finally gotten free. When I left work, I decided to alleviate some stress by stopping at a little bar. I figured I'd have a couple of drinks and some food, and take my mind off things a little bit. After being seated for just a couple of minutes, the bartender came over. This drink is from the guy at the end, she said. I thought to myself that this is interesting, since no guy had ever bought me a drink before. We ended up talking for hours, and before I knew it I was feeling pretty good. I told myself that I deserved to relax though, and I was safe to drive. On the way home, it all started to hit me. However I only lived 2 miles away and knew that I could make it. Suddenly I saw a bright flash of light, heard screeching, and then nothing. I awoke in the emergency room with a concussion and severely fractured arm. Now, on top of ex problems, I'd have to take time off work. Definitely a lesson learned.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
755,"A week ago my daughter and I were talking about her skateboarding goals. I knew she had been working really hard to improve and I strongly support her with all of it. Her father and I took her to the park to practice. We all know that the only way to get great at skateboarding is to get out there and actually do it. She has some difficult goals but she believes that they will be worth all of the effort and practice once she gets to where she wants to be. I was helping to coach her learning to drop in on a large quarter pipe. Everything looked good but then in just seconds, things did not go as planned. She took a pretty hard fall and it really scared me. It did not take her long to get right back up and get her focus back to where it needed to be. The look on her dad's face went from fear and concern to a genuine look of admiration almost immediately. It turned out to be a great learning experience and we plan to do it again next week. We will most likely be going every week for a while. We live in an area that is warm almost all year. This is a great goal for my daughter for where we live.

756,"A few months ago, I was in desperate need of some extra income.  The reason, I needed to purchase equipment and a new computer so I can self-teach myself animation and improve on my drawing/sketching ability.  Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to pursue my goals. I had to do something but I was not going to force anything that cost me money or put me debt.  I was bit sad about the situation because like some things in life, people want immediately results.  I needed to be patient, something I have always had an issue with.  However, I was not going to force the issue this time as I had mentioned before. One night out of the blue, a friend and had not hung with for a while wanted to meet up and chat with me about things going in his life and things going on in my life.  My friend picked me up on a Saturday afternoon and we just decided to drive around and talk about life. Because we became hungry after a while, we decided to head to the local casino and eat at the buffet.  You just cannot beat all-you-can-eat for a good price.   Also, I had not been to the casino in years because the last time I went, I cost myself over $100 and vowed not to go again.  However, my friend wanted to go and I did not want to stop him.  After we ate, we decided to sit down and play a couple of slot machine to waste time and test our luck.  As luck would have, I ended up winning about 400 bucks off of just $20 I spent.  My friend did not know I was down to my last 50 before going to the casino, so this money came in hand in a big way.  Now, I am not a religious guy but I will admit I looked up and said thank you to whoever the big man or woman is in the sky.  That money was more than what I needed to get the equipment I needed to purchases as well as purchase a low-cost, online animation course that set me on my way.  I was even able to give my friend $50 just for the hell of it. You just never know when you will be blessed with positive things.  I was so happy that I couldn't contain myself and almost started to cry but held together and just kept a joyful laughter for about a 5 minutes.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

I'm still amazed at what happened two weeks ago, and have to tell you about it! You know how I did that DNA test a while ago? Well I got the results back, and there was actually a cousin I never knew I had who lived just a mile away in our little senior community! From what I understand, she's a cousin on my father's side, the daughter of his sister. I guess there was some bad blood between her and her parents when she was young, and so she ran away. I'm not sure if my crazy aunt (she really is a piece of work) ever tried to look for her or filed a missing person's report or anything, but this missing cousin ended up right near me after all these years! It took me a few days, Diary, to get up the courage to try to contact her. Finally, I looked her up on the internet and found a number for her. I dialed, said who I was and what the DNA test had revealed, and, surprisingly, she was so thrilled to hear from me! We made a date for coffee at the little shop that's part of our community. When I walked in, I could spot her right away. I could see the family resemblance right away! We must have talked for three hours! Turns out after she left, she got in with a bad crowd, but turned her life around after she got pregnant. She raised her kid the best she could (he turned out great and such a handsome young man!) and worked her way up to head buyer for her company. What's even more amazing is that she's a horror movie fan, just like me! I'm looking forward to hanging out with her more, and to meeting her son as well. Gotta go, Diary. So much work to do, but I wanted to share this with you! Millie",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,

It was my step-father. He wanted to see how I was doing even though we hadn't spoken in several years. Growing up we had a rocky relationship. We never really got along and argued a lot. I felt like he always tried to be my dad and I didn't want him to. Sometimes our arguments turned physical. But now that we were on the phone our conversation was calm. We spoke about my childhood and his relationship with my mother. It was a rough conversation at first but then it got better over time. The conversation was emotional and we caught up for a bit before hanging up. We agreed we would try to stay in tough more often.,memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
759,"I just had the best time at the local zoo! It was a perfect day and it wasn't too crowded but the best part of all was I fed a giraffe for the first time. Actually I spent about an hour and a day's pay feeding giraffes. I couldn't stop, they were so beautiful. I don't know what it was about them, I don't usually like big animals like that but they were so gentle and friendly. I couldn't believe I was standing there face to face with a giraffe. It let me caress it's fuzzy ear antlers or horns or whatever those little nubbins are. I think the most surprising thing was when I felt a long black tongue, smooth like a dog's but not nearly as wet, as I put a leave up to it's mouth. It was like time stood still and nothing else mattered but me and that giraffe! I had fantastical ideas like saddling it and riding away, and wondered if that was even possible. I looked in it's eyes and I felt like we had some sort of cosmic connection. I don't believe in souls but if there were souls I think that giraffe definitely had one! It's really inspired me to work closer with animals. I know I can't train a giraffe like I train the dogs at work but I'd love to work up close with them one day. I will never, ever forget this day.

He got very sick with pneumonia, and went to the hospital. When he was in the hospital they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. While he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath.  I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder.

She was the family punching bag. Whenever something went wrong, it was Katie's fault. It didn't matter who did it, how it happened, the fact that Katie was in another state at the time -- the entire family, including her two sisters, would gang up and yell at her. So Katie's sister, Krystal, is getting married into a conservative Greek Orthodox family. She's losing her mind because she wants so bad for her new family to think she's perfect, which is laughable, but whatever. Of course, the morning of the wedding, everything is going wrong and how dare Katie do this, despite the fact that Katie wasn't even awake when everything started happening. Makeup if misplaced, boxes haven't been taken up to the church for decorating, the works. So they all load up and head to the church to get the place ready. Katie grabs a box nearly as big as her hauls it into the church, and asks Krystal where it needs to go, to which she responds, ""OH MY GOD KATIE JUST SET IT DOWN SOMEWHERE!""Katie, being the sweetheart she is, sets it down somewhere out of the way so people won't trip on it, but still in a higher traffic area so it can be found. She goes to put on her dress because some of the groomsmen are putting up the decorations. Of course, Krystal screeches like a banshee not ten minutes later because something in the box Katie had carried in needed refrigeration, but Katie was not informed of that. Not only was it not in the refrigerator, but Katie cleary hid it so nobody else could find it because she was trying to ruin the wedding. Katie apologizes and shows her where the box is. Katie will hold Krystal's bouquet (the other sister couldn't do it for whatever reason -- it was probably too heavy for her poor, dainty arms). So Katie verifies how that's going to work. ""So you give it to me, there's some talking, you and Carl walk around the altar a few times, then I give it back to you?"" Krystal doesn't answer, and after a few more questions, she dismissively says, ""yeah, yeah, you give it back to me.""During the ceremony, Krystal never makes a move to take the bouquet back, and does not accept it when offered. Katie is yelled at about this after the ceremony. Then they get in a huge fight, katie was so angry, she was crying.

The meal I had in front of me unfortunately was not high enough on sugar to compensate for this. I had to run to the kitchen to see what I could find. Unfortunately, we had no juice in the house at all that I could drink. I went looking for cookies in the cabinets but once again I could not find any. I was starting to panic at this point. There was no one else in the house that could help me if I blacked out. I could seriously die. I finally remembered that I would occasionally keep a candy bar in my bag just for such an occasion. Rushing to the bedroom, I hoped against hope that I had not eaten it already and it was still there. Luckily, it was. I quickly scarfed down the chocolate bar, savoring every bite as best I could.

To the stock of spare parts in the company for me it was a very frustrating situation since I had no professional knowledge for the new assignment of work therefore. I was in charge of the position for 6 months but not feeling comfortable I asked for the resignation to locate another job in my outstanding area of work. It was really frustrating for me to be in that situation since I had to financially support my family and also get a new job where both me and my bosses would consider me appropriate and prepared to face the challenges and be able to develop in the area as I was prepared for my job. Previously, in the sales area, therefore, my opportunity was to migrate to another company where I could accommodate my potential and be able to exploit it and in that way continue to stand out and not go through uncomfortable situations within the area where I was working after the dismissal of my colleagues. I am sure that for me and for the company it is more productive for me to start in another company than to continue working in the current one since in addition to not having the necessary knowledge.

From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring. But there‚Äôs nothing very like seeing your baby crawling for the primary time. Many guardians are on edge to see their child crawl and closely screen their baby‚Äôs improvements. Of course, there‚Äôs completely nothing off-base with that! In any case, it‚Äôs vital to keep in mind that all babies are diverse and take after a distinctive advancement path.

I looked to see where the voice came from and it was from a boy no older than my 8 year old nephew back home. He alerted me early enough to see what was happening. A thief was trying to slash my bag to take my wallet. My eyes connected with the thief's and I first saw panic in his, then came anger and headed straight towards the little boy. Thankfully, someone was close enough to the little boy to protect him from the thief. The thief got tackled to the ground by two men from the gathering audience. The boy was then taken into a shop nearby to make sure that he was safe. I went to the shop where the boy was to express my gratitude and tell him how I thought he's very brave for what he's done. The boy smiled at me and said that he was only doing the right thing. I then bought him $25 worth of candy in the store to reward him and I could swear that he's the happiest boy on earth that day. I stepped out of the store to see two policemen taking the thief into custody. They were actually looking for me to take my testimony and asking if I wanted to press charges against him. I went with the policemen to the precinct for the paper works and the thief was in jail 10 minutes later.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
774,"five hours might seem like a long time, but when i'm with them it goes by like it was in an instant. I remember so many great moments from that trip, like when Tom got caught peeing behind the bushes on the 12th hole! i mean we all had to go but of course Tom couldn't wait, he's always like that.         But probably the weirdest thing was something that you see in an Adam Sandler movie. I was on the 5th hole when i got a water foul, but it wasn't just any old regular foul. I'm watching in horror as my ball flies towards the lake and then CHOMP a gator comes out and swallows it! I was shocked, and asked the manager about it later just to find out thats ""Bill"".  Apparently he roams these here parts, and has done so for about the last 6 years. Unbelievable i know, but hey what can you do these things happen i guess? Man, it really doesn't feel like it was 2 months ago, it feels like yesterday and i already can't wait to get back out there and meet Bill again.        And in the end, who do you think ended up winning all that prize money for our little wager? yeah thats right, me and Ron blew it out of the water (or sand if you prefer). I mean i felt bad of course and wanted to treat the guys to something special for being good sports. After the game we went down to the local bar ""Charley's"" and had a round on me. Of course one round is never enough for us and we ended up being there until about midnight before calling a taxi and heading home. What a night to remember!",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,

I have been very hesitant about getting involved with someone new after my divorce in 2010, which was painful and financially devastating. My boyfriend, Mark, is different than anyone I have ever known. We are an older couple, me being 52 and him being 60. He's never lived with a girlfriend or been married. For me, I did not want to be involved with someone who would dominate my life, or try to control me. I've been alone for several years now and have come to appreciate my independence. Push came to shove for me last spring when Mark's mother, who he was a caretaker for, went into an assisted living facility. This left Mark alone and financially destititute. I made the leap of faith and moved in with him. I am now the breadwinner for our new family and he is looking for work. Its not always easy, but we are very happy and live a quiet life. We plan to get married this coming winter. There was a happy ending to this story.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

She was such an adorable little yellow lab puppy.  So anyway, it's been about four weeks since we saw her picture (even though she's eight weeks old today) so we headed out for the ride to get her.  It was about an hour and a half drive to the farm that she was living on.  When we pulled up, there was a huge fenced in area with a bunch of other dogs in it.  They all looked so happy and ran to the edge of the fence to check us out.  We hopped out and were greeted by Samantha and her husband Jim and they welcomed us inside.  We chatted for a few minutes before following them out back to where the little puppies were.  There, in a little pile, was our baby Gemma.  She looked so happy and we picked her up and squeezed her and she wriggled around before hopping back down.  We spoke to Jim and Samantha  a bit longer before scooping our girl up again and getting her into the car.  She was very brave for her first long car ride in her little car seat and when we got home, we let her free and she just seemed so happy, like she had been meant to be with us all along.  Today has been one of the happiest days as of recent.  I love Gemma so much and I think we're all going to be very happy together.",memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,

I got mad and challenged him to fight. We have since made up and i told him its ok lets move on. But i really dont want to associate with him any more.

780,"This happen on St. Patrick's Day in March of 2019. I live about 20 minutes away from The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa, FL. The buffet at the casino was having a menu special for the holiday, with a lot of Irish dishes such as shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, and fish and chips. I had planned to take my parents to eat at the buffet since my dad's birthday was coming up. The plan was to go right when they open because it can get pretty busy during these special menu days. My father must have forgotten and had eaten a big breakfast in the morning so he declined to go, and my parents were out of the trip. Not wanting to waste the special menu day, I head over there to partake in the buffet special. The meal was delicious, from eggs benedict to prime rib and then fish and chips and I discovered I'm not a fan of corned beef. The meal was for free, as I was an elite member at the casino since I do gamble regularly. After I was done, I decided to head to the high limit area of the casino. I had won quiet a bit since the beginning of the year, and I had a pretty high bankroll. I start with around 1500 dollars and begin to play. I wasn't really looking to take any risk, but being full from the delicious feast, I decided to entertain myself and gamble a bit. It did not take long to lose all my money. Now I was on full tilt, frustrated with my enormous losses. Instead of walking out, I decided to make a withdraw of another 1500. Down another 500, I decide to try one more machine. After a few spins, I hit the bonus playing at 20 a spin. The bonus game is pretty unique with the multiplier of win line hits goes up after every free game. The thing that happened was when there was a 7x multiplier, I had a line hit for over 7000!! The bonus ended with almost winning 9500 which is my biggest jackpot every. I was very emotional, with shock and disbelief of what occurred. This was a gift, as it helped me pay down a lot of debt.

781,Dear diary. So I know it has been a while since I have written in you but I just wanted to keep you updated. About a month ago I woke up with some pretty bad tooth pain. Most of the morning I was in pain and finnaly ended up calling the doctor about it. They told me I should call my dentist as there was nothing they could do. So I call them and they told me that I had to wait until the next day in order to even see them. I tried taking pain meds and orajel and it did help a little bit but not as much as I hoped. So the next morning came around and I finnaly went there and the told me I needed a root canal! I was pretty nervous that it would hurt quite a bit but I knew in the long run it would be better for my teeth. So after about a 15 minute procedure it was all over. They were nice for the most part but boy did it hurt quite a bit. I would say after about 15 minutes it started to hurt worse but they did give me much better pain pills to deal with it. Later that night I was starting to feel a bit better. When I work up in the morning I was pain free and it was great. Overall I am glad I went and got it done quickly.,memories,3,False,,,,,,,,,
782,"About six weeks ago on my solo motorcycle trip to Canada I had a truly unforgettable experience while camping for the night. I was alone in a remote area of northern Wyoming and heard a terrifying sound at about 3AM.  I had intended to camp at a developed site next to a lake because it was bear country and there were bear-proof storage boxes at the campsites.  When I arrived at the lake I was disappointed in the area, there was nobody there (it was a weekday) but it was obviously heavily used and a bit dumpy.  I decided to ride further down the dirt road to see what else there might be.  I came across a trail and after a mile or so there was a small clearing in the trees.  I thought that it would make a suitable site to set up the tent.  It was a bit eerie - there were forest fires in the region and the sky was reddish from the smoke, there was also Spanish moss hanging from the tree branches which added to the creepy atmosphere.  At any rate, I made dinner, enjoyed a beer and went to sleep at about 11PM.  I was awakened by a piercing scream at around 3AM, it was absolutely terrifying and I had never heard anything like it before.  All that came to mind at the time was that there was a large bird like a eagle outside the tent screeching at something.  As I listened I could hear it walking around the tent about 100' away, there were small branches breaking under it's feet as it walked along... whatever it was it seemed pretty big.  I was too scared to open the zipper and look outside the tent, I didn't want to draw attention to myself and have to deal with this thing up close.  After over an hour the sounds became more and more faint and I eventually drifted to sleep.  In the morning I examined the ground where I had imagined it had been walking.  I found some very clear large paw prints - it was a mountain lion!  I have never seen a mountain lion in the wild, and the sound that it was making that night was otherworldly, something I'll never forget.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
783,"Dear Diary, On my birthday this year I turned 54 years old and reached the nine year anniversary of a dreadful time that forever changed my life. To celebrate and mark the occasion my grown son took me to Walt Disney World for a week long vacation. I had never been to Disney World and, being a lifetime fan of Disneyland, having the chance to experience this park with my son was a dream come true. I had become very ill nine years ago and nearly lost my life to liver and heart failure. The illness came out of the blue and remains an unknown etiology as far as my physician is concerned. My recovery and transformation has been time consuming and come with many changes to my life, abilities, and career. My son walked along my side during my illness and knew that reaching a point where I could travel with him would be the best reward I could hope for. Our vacation was amazing from the moment we reached Florida and boarded the Disney bus. Our resort hotel was absolutely beautiful and the parks were amazing. Animal Kingdom was by far our favorite resort with Epcot a close second. My son had been very careful to book all of our dining reservations with my needs in mind. A chef came to our table to ask me about my dietary restrictions and made beautiful meals for me. We even had a refrigerator and microwave in our room so I could prepare my own breakfast each day. We both agreed that Disneyland still outshines any theme park and will be our family favorite. I rarely spend long periods of time with my son since he is 32, very busy in his career, and travels the world for business. Having this week with him, building memories, and sharing new experiences is a time I will always treasure.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

Something about it just sings, and it has a warmth and a depth to it that makes it very satisfying to play. I know that I will remember this day for the rest of my life. When I decided to buy it, Bob shared my excitement. He gave me a discount on a bag for it, and he also gave me several other things for free.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,
799,"Dear Diary,I spoke to Grandma today or at least I tried to. I will admit that I don't go to visit her nearly as much as I should in the nursing home but to be honest it really just breaks my heart to do so. She seems so miserable and she looks so unhealthy. She's lost so much weight and her hair has gotten so white and thin. It's hard to look at this sickly and frail old woman and try to equate her with the strong and sweet woman that I grew up with. Living over an hour away most of our conversations have had to be over the phone and maybe that's just better for us both. Sometimes when I do visit she cries a lot and I feel so awful because there's nothing I can do to alleviate her sadness and pain. I was working from home today and my mom called to tell me that she was visiting Nana and that Nana wanted to talk to me. I've always been a really literal person so I pay a lot of attention not only to what people say but how they say it. She didn't say that she wanted me to talk to Nana, but that Nana wanted to talk to me. Which meant that she asked my mom to contact me. I know this might not seem like a big deal to most people, but it really was a huge deal to me because Nana has had a series of strokes over the past few years and her speech never truly recovered from the last one. Communicating is extremely frustrating for her as well as us. So that means that she was able to communicate well enough that my mother was able to understand what she wanted her to do. So, I told my mom to go ahead and put her on the phone. As soon as I heard her voice filter through the headset, I greeted her warmly and asked if the hospital staff was treating her well. She started trying to say something and was stammering really badly. Knowing that this is the point in which she usually gets frustrated and gives up, I encouraged her to think very carefully about what she wanted to say and try again. We went through that for several minutes before she could finally get out the words that ""She had me on her mind and she just wanted to tell me that she loved me."" The rest of our conversation was pretty much me guessing what she was trying to convey and her either confirming or denying that my guess was right. I remain astounded that those words were completely clear and everything else she said was gibberish. It was as if she had said the most important thing and was ok with everything else being muddled.",memories,3,True,,,,,,,,,

I thought, going in, that they were just going to do my top surgery, bandage me up, and then I'd go in for a couple follow-up check-ups to make sure things were healing alright. But no, I should have known better. Of course with an incision big enough to remove my entire breast on either side, there's going to be some fluid build-up while it's healing. That said, it is definitely not a comfortable thing. Right now, I have clear tubing coming from either incision. The tubing leads to these pod-shaped 'bottles' that collect all of the gross fluids from my surgery recovery. I've been using a stretchy ace bandage around my midsection to tuck the drainage containers into so they don't interfere with things. But, despite my best efforts, they still manage to slip around and get loose or shift and dig into my rib-cage. Finally, FINALLY, I get to get these things taken out. No more stinging when the tubes get pulled on, no more itching bandaging, no more nausea-inducing emptying of who-knows-what down the sink at the end of every day.
