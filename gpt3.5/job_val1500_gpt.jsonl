I took it for a test drive and immediately fell in love with it.

I kept getting those excited butterflies in my stomach and could not wait to get the keys to this car. I could not wait to drive my son around and tell him that mommy got this all on her own and I was so proud of myself and I hope that one day he would be proud of me as well.

Maybe I'm ready for my life to mean something more than...to be about something more than just me, just getting through, just going from one moment to the next. I keep thinking about the future. What it looks like, what's going to happen after I'm gone. I never really thought much about it before, never really thought about the past either for that matter. And now, all of a sudden, it's like time has just opened up before me. I think about the baby inside me. Who are they going to be? Where are they going to end up? How will they change the world. I keep think too about the past, all the people before me who were once children, were once babies growing inside someone's stomach. It makes me dizzy, like looking up at the stars from the top of the mountain--how they just keep going and going. It scares me too, makes me afraid for this little life I'm going to bring into the world. How can I keep them safe?

I fed her electrolytes and special vet recovery food and she did well for a little bit but then she just didn't make it.  She ended up having seizures and dying a week later.

She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years.  We were very pleased to see what she was doing. This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation.

I remembeed all the little girls that I wanted or did kiss. ai remembered where my old locker was and it turns out that it was in tha same hall as mine. I wonder if I would have been friends with my daughter if things were different and she wasnt my daughter but just another peer. I talked to her about all of the things that were going through my head and she said that I was weirding her out. Then I asked her about what high school she wanted to go to because she had the choice of three different schools in the area. She said that she wasnt sure cause she wanrwed to go to a school that the majority of her friends went to but she also wanted to not be distracted because of them as well. I on the other hand made the decision ro go to a school that none of my friends went to so that I could focus on studies and it wasnt a very god choice for me. I ended up having as really haed time because I didnt know any one and in turn it affected my studies in a negative way becaus I never wanted to go to class I wanted to go and hang ouy with my friends.

It felt like we were transplanted back to the late nineteenth century. There were reenactors dressed up like the Wilder family. They had all the old tools and machinery commonly seen around settler homes back then. They were doing ordinary daily chores like scrubbing clothes. We even got to see a settler churning real butter from cream. Then there were the animals. I think this was my favorite part. Seeing how the cows and other animals were kept and maintained was kind of a thrill to me. By the end of the day we were both exhausted. I don't know if we'll ever make it back out to see the home again but it won't be for lack of trying."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

When I hit the ground, I felt incredible pain in my left leg. After standing up and trying to walk, I couldn't put any pressure on my leg and the pain was almost overwhelming. Luckily, my wife was home at the time and drove me to the hospital. After waiting for over an hour, I was finally seen by a doctor in the emergency room.  The doctor began the examination by moving my leg and I nearly screamed from the pain. He gave my a shot filled with pain medication of some kind and sent me for a x-ray. The x-ray determined that my leg had fractured just below the knee.  Luckily, it was a clean break. I was given a flexible cast, a prescription for antibiotics and pain pills, and sent home. It has now been about a month since the accident. I am no longer in pain. The flex cast can come off in about two weeks.

I have for about 6 months now noticed a sudden change of behavior, everything we shared and enjoyed together all of a sudden doesn't make sense to her anymore. She now complains about almost everything, on days when i call regularly she complains of me disturbing her. On days when i'm too busy to call however she says i'm not been caring enough. I later found out she was seeing another person who happened to be someone i knew and they were both trying to hide the relationship from me. It was had pill to swallow but life most go on. What i'm still trying to wrap my head around is why she didn't just break up instead of the torments she was putting me through.

This is the most exciting experience I have ever experienced. Last summer I wrote a journal travel diary to Europe and after a year I visited these diary entries again. Please remember the ups and downs of trains and planes through Spain and Italy while drinking coffee with important people. I am on the other side of this creature fence, but I know that my expecting wife wants to review pregnancy and learn from the first regression. From various foods to various emotions and triggers of various physical symptoms, by attaching a specific pregnancy diary, the burden can be reduced because the term passed. ter completing my Yellowstone work contract in late September, I drove the spectacular BearTooth Highway and went from there to the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument. Then from Custer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Last Stand it was on to Custer, S.D. where I saw the annual Buffalo Roundup. Then I headed to Estes Park, Colorado to see friends I worked with last summer.

I was on the way back, and I noticed a car driving slowly next to me, and I heard a couple of sharp cracks, and I was startled, I thought maybe a tree had fallen or something. Very quickly I noticed a sharp pain in my back, and while this was going on,  I noticed one of the people in the car was leaning out the window staring at me. I saw her ugly brown face staring at me, and saw she was holding something. As it turned out, it was a paintball gun, and was still shooting at me. This 'disadvantaged' ethnic minority type had just injured me, but not badly enough, she wanted to shoot me in the face or something, so maybe I'd fall off my bike and get hurt real bad, as some form of liberal social justice. Well, I stopped my bike, and reached into my fanny pack to my own gun, a real one, and they quickly sped up their car and drove away. I considered taking a shot at them, but I realized it was unlikely I'd hit them, and so I decided against it. I was in a decent amount of pain by this point, but I decided to take a detour to the liquor store instead of going straight home, picked up a 6 pack of beer, and had the people at the store tell me how much paint and crap were on my shirt, and backpack.  As it turned out, my backpack had absorbed most of the shots, so it was the article of clothing that was most paint-soaked. I got my beer, and painfully cycled home. When I arrived I took off my backpack, and shirt, and observed the injury in the mirror, it was like there was a golf ball sized dent in one of the large muscles of my back, and a nice fist sized red mark surrounding it. I put some ice on the injury, drank my beer, and tried to sleep, though it really hurt. Since then, I've been more cautious about passing cars, and bystanders in general, and I've practiced getting out my gun more quickly in case something like this happens again. I've also thought about it a lot, if someone assaults me in a similar way in the future, am I prepared to respond to them with lethal force? The answer to that is yes, I only suffered a minor injury but if things had happened a bit differently I could have been hurt very badly, and it's only right, that surrounded by people who will hurt me badly for no reason at all, other than some vague ethnic/identity/liberal ideology, I have to be prepared to hurt them first, to protect myself, at all times."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

Well, Craig drove on out probably 150 miles or more, and helped us get going again.  That's the first time I met the man! After living in Georgia for awhile I soon learned that it was NOT anything like California.  Church is big around here.  BIG.  So I got involved with the Church, through Craig, and we started helping put roofs on the houses of widows.  Tough work for sure, but it was extremely rewarding.

We talked - for hours - about the true meaning of life, its purpose, and what to do when you are unhappy. Some people say that if you are not happy in life, change it. Find another job. Move. However, if you are already in the society trap of the American Dream, escape is not so easy. Well, at least not if you have a conscious. There is a scene in the movie \"Office Space\" that really strikes home. In a moment of clarity, Peter, the main character, tell his psychologist that each day he wakes up is the worst day of his life. I feel him. My memorable event was not something that happened \"to me,\" but an awakening inside me. I now find myself thinking about this each day, planning how I might change things, trying to find the courage to become the person I want to be, to live the life I have always wanted. Too bad I have been living the life others told me would make me happy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

I couldn't talk and when attempting to do so, it was very painful. This was the week before memorial weekend. I reached out to my boss via email and explained the situation to her, she had already been aware that my voice was in bad shape.   I had to call out. I called out but didn't go to the doctor that day. I figured I would drink some tea, and would be fine, well I had hoped I would be fine. I woke up the next day, which was my day off and it had gotten worse. my glands were severely swollen. I didn't have health insurance so I had no choice but to go to the hospital, which I incurred a $800 bill due to that visit. Now I forgot to mention that fact, that now my glands are swollen I freaked out, because my dad had passed away from throat cancer and prior to that so did his father. I was scared to death sitting in the waiting area, waiting to be called. After sitting in the waiting room literally for 4 hours I was then seen by urgent care. He looked in my throat never even checked my glands and told me it's possible it was a virus. He gave me a shot of Steroids in which he stated will help the swelling to go down, and he made me an appointment with an ENT specialist. The appointment was 2 weeks away. My voice got a little better, but there was no way I was able to talk on the phones for 8 hours especially since I had 3 upsells per phone call. I used up my personal days. I reached out to my boss and informed her that I was going to have to resign, my appointment was two weeks away, I was freaking out thinking it might be cancer. The doctor only gave me a note for 3 days. if I was out one more day. She put a recommendation in for me to be rehired. I went to my ENT doctor and he said I had a virus and he took a better look at my glands and said my glands being swollen was due to me having blockage in one of my saliva glands and not drinking enough water caused it to flair up and lose my voice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

Fortunately, I was able to come back down to earth and convince myself it would be worth it to go, especially when we talked with some local divers that said that the person was snorkeling in an unsanctioned area known for shark activity and that they had not taken proper safety precautions. I knew that I would always spring for the safer option, and that's what we ended up doing. It ended up being a giant thrill! Seeing the immense array of colorful animals and the diversity below the surface really opens your eyes to how full of life our planet is. I honestly think I could snorkel full-time, it was that exciting! So much so that our planned 1 snorkeling event turned into a 3-day snorkeling tour that we signed up and which blew me away.

I had been trying to prove myself as an good employee and a great asset to the team for a little over a year now, but my manager would always tell me that a promotion just isn't in the budget, to keep trying. There were certainly times I felt like giving up and that I was never going to get the raise, and I had even started looking for a new job. What I was making just was not enough money for me to live my life the way I wanted to live it. Well, a few months ago, my supervisor and only other person on my team broke his pelvis. Since the injury was so severe, he has been out of the office for going on three months now, leaving me alone to do ALL of the work we were once both responsible for. The circumstances were horrible for him, but it was my time to shine and prove myself to my boss. I took on extra tasks, regularly stay late, and am a bigger part of meetings my supervisor used to run. Because of how willing to do extra work I was, people started to take notice and none of our regular processes had any interruptions. My boss and other colleagues began to take notice of how I was working. I was receiving a lot of praise, and it felt good, but it was just that. It was all just praise, nothing material came of it. Well, last week I was called into a meeting with my manager and my director to discuss all of the work I had been doing. In this meeting, they discussed with me a promotion they were going to give me and allowed me to negotiate a higher pay as a thanks for all of my hard work. They had realized how instrumental I was to the team and wanted to keep me happy working here. I was ecstatic. I had finally gotten the recognition I had deserved and had finally gotten the raise I had worked so hard for. Life is good. I now hold so much more pride in my work and I think my future performance will reflect that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

It was peaceful but contractions were difficult and I was worried that I would not be able to completed my labor and delivery without pain medication. When my husband woke up around midnight and asked if I wanted company, I said yes, and felt relief that at least he would be there. He began helping me through contractions using accupressure, which helped immensely - so much so that I had renewed hope for a natural labor. We left for the hospital around 2:00am and got checked in by 3:30am. I was so so thankful that I had progressed so far on my own by the time I was admitted. At that point, I felt sure that I could do this. We got to the hospital room and I got into a warm tub. I labored there for only a few minutes before I felt that she was going to come soon. I got out and began pushing while in a bed. It's such a relief to be able to push when your body tells you to push.

Well, here we go with the explanation.  I kept going to my usual doctor and he kept doing the usual:  telling me to lose weight and stop smoking.  Anyway, as you know a few months ago, he wasn't in the office on my appointment day and I ended up just seeing his P.A.  She ordered some more detailed lab work because she was actually concerned about everything I was describing.  Well, the blood tests came back (as you already know) and she called me and wanted to refer me to a hematologist.  Went and saw the blood-doc a month ago.  Why so long?  Well, it takes forever to get in to see these guys around here.  Anyway, the new doctor, Margaret, took more blood and I just got the results a couple of weeks ago.  It seems that I have a little genetic problem and that resulted in being diagnosed with a pretty rare form of leukemia.  It's called Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or CMML.  She also said that I have a specific sub-type, CMML-2.  This is NOT good!

I moved from my parents house and packed up all my belongings over the course of a week or so, then my girlfriend drove down from Northern Maine(I lived in Mass). We loaded up her car and mine, and began the 7 hour drive to our new place. After several weeks of preparation, organizing everything and getting stuff set up and purchased how we would need them, we were finally ready for this huge transition. In the coming weeks after that long drive, we unpacked everything and set up our new place how we wanted it. There was a lot of frustration and sweat and swearing as we struggled to shift furniture around the apartment, but we managed. Then some weeks later, I managed to find a job in a medical office. A position I took to readily and have since been excelling at. The actual act of moving was a stressful one, we spent a lot of time worrying ourselves over money, over my ability to find a job, over how I\"d manage to work out my schooling, all of it. Not to mention the fact that my family strongly disapproved of the decision and began treating me incredibly poorly once I broke the news to them. We drove for several hours before making our first stop, me trailing behind her, as her car was larger and she had packed it up to the point where she couldn't really see behind her. We stopped to pick up something to drink and use the restroom, as well as refuel our cars. THe drive was one we'd made many times before so the actual act of driving wasn't too bad, however, it was somewhat exhausting for her since she made the drive down just the day prior. With the cars refueled we went a ways further, before stopping for some Burger King. The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, and we stopped first at our new apartment to drop off some of the stuff. However, since we got in at around 10pm, we were too tired to really move everything in in earnest, so we went to her parent's house to sleep. Bright and early the next day, we began the long process of moving my stuff, as well as hers, into our new place. Hours upon hours of moving stuff, lifting it up stairs, shifting it around, just general struggle. But ultimately, we have our place exactly how we want it, and I loved the experience."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

At the end of my lessons I usually chat a bit with my teacher, as it's difficult to fill up an entire half hour lesson with nothing but teachings about guitar and going over scales and such. During each lesson he gets me to play through whatever song or scale or technique he had been teaching me the week (or multiple weeks) earlier. This particular lesson while we were talking he paused for a moment and brought up that he'd noticed I was really struggling to learn a particular song, and that it had been \"beating me up\" for several weeks as I was attempting to learn it. I had been practicing the song a lot but I wasn't getting much better at it despite my best efforts, and I was concerned that it appeared to him that I wasn't actually practicing it enough due to my abilities not improving much over time. He remarked that he admired the fact that I was determined enough to keep sticking with it and carrying on despite how challenging it was for me to learn the song. He also told me that as he was old enough to be my father, he felt it was appropriate to tell me that he was very proud of me with how far I had come with learning guitar, and that he has many students who drop out after only a few months of taking lessons. I thanked him and was left a little bit speechless by his words, it was unexpected and it meant a lot to me that he was really seeing my progress over time - especially when I was worried because I myself wasn't seeing much of my own improvements. As I was leaving at the end of the lesson he reminded me to keep working at it and that I would eventually be able to play it, it would just take time. His comments renewed my desire to learn the song and I was motivated to continue learning it over the next few weeks. I got to a point where I was able to play it with minimal mistakes and better timing than before. I was quite touched by it because not many people are so genuine and open with their thoughts or compliments about others, and I don't often receive praise like that in my everyday life. It can be frustrating taking up a new hobby, especially if you're not good at it and to hear recognition that you're doing well and still progressing can alleviate some insecurities about your lack of ability. It can also motivate you more to keep pursuing it even if it is difficult. I am someone who grew up without a father figure in my life, and hearing such praise from someone I look up to and is a role model to me made it even more meaningful."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

Needless to say, we were exhausted at the end of the day, but it was worth it!  We got to ride all the rides we wanted, got to try three different kinds of butterbeer, and got to have ice cream from Florean Fortescue's.  Our favorite ride was the one that goes through the Hogwarts castle. It was like being right there in the movies!  Another good one was the ride that went through Gringotts Bank.  It was funny to watch the people jump when the dragon on top blew his fireball.  We made sure to eat at both The Leaky Cauldron and The Three Broomsticks.  Both had really good food, especially for a theme park.  While we were there, we heard that they're going to open a new ride that's based on Hagrid's motorcycle We will have to make a return trip to ride that one once the hype has died down.  Another of our favorite spots was the Dr. Seuss world.  It was fun to see all the characters, and they seemed to have some of the best shirts and merchandise. A really cool restaurant was the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium.  It's decorated in 19th century steampunk decor, and was really unusual.

She had always been so sweet and welcoming to me and I felt very close to her.  When she had to go into the nursing home after her knee replacement surgery, it wasn't that big of a deal because it was only for rehabilitation, so it wasn't like she was giving up her independence.  She was going to be back in her own home in about 6 weeks.  But she never went home.  During orthopedic rehab she fell and injured her other leg.  Of course everyone in her family was upset and so was I, but we still didn't think that it was a life threatening injury.  Then, after she was transferred back to the hospital, she developed a blood clot in the leg, it shot to her lungs and she was gone overnight.  My reaction was shock, I could hardly believe it could happen like that.  At first my boyfriend and the rest of the family seemed to be reacting the same way, in other words in an appropriate way.  Then after the funeral, things started to change.  People started making comments along the lines of how they felt relieved  that she was gone because they wouldn't have wanted to take care of her if she hadn't recovered well from the fall injury.  More and more family member started to agree with this, even my boyfriend.  They all seemed to be over their grief so quickly.  This response has been so devastating to me.

I think what held me back was the fear of the whole process, but with the realtor I found and the information on the web I researched, it wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t as painful as I anticipated.

It was a potluck type event, but there was plenty of good food to be had like hotdogs, burgers, and macaroni salad. I ate a lot more than I anticipated and gave myself a bit of a stomachache but I still don't regret it either because I enjoyed it all. Along with the fishing contest there were other activities like frog catching with nets, with prizes for catching the biggest frog or fish. After that was the annual picture with all the kids and young adults who hadn't reached thirty yet, I was in that photo too. Then after we did that we watched the littler kids all participate in the frog race, where on a sheet they would race the captured frogs to win other prizes. I didn't participate in the games because I had already outgrown the age range of the kids participating. It was fun just watching the kids and teens have fun though, and I got to eat more while I watched. I indulged myself in dessert and talking to some of the family members I didn't usually get many chances to see casually. Also I nearly had a frog jump on me during the frog race for the kids. While I like frogs, I don't like slimy feels so I jumped back a bit when the kids were releasing all the caught frogs back into the pond. At the end of the event we all got commemorative coins for the event that my aunt had specially prepared for the occasion and I was happy to get one. Before I left the event to go home, I picked some wild apples from an apple tree near the road entrance on my aunt's property with my mom, who'd attended the event with me.

Needless to say from the start of my entry, that is not what happened at all.   In all our years, this was the first time he took me home with him for the holidays.  We usually went to my family events because his parents usually traveled to Peru for the holidays.  Since his grandmother had passed, they had no reason to go this year. and his mother made all kinds of elaborate plans that would span 5 days.  He must have asked me a thousand times if I wanted to go or not, or if I would be comfortable with all of his family speaking Spanish.  I am fluent - he knows this.  But, I thought he was just being considerate seeing that I am the only white person coming - the only person who does not have Hispanic roots, period. I assured him that I was fine, and I would be prepared for a bit of a cold shoulder coming at me.  I was tougher than I looked.  We arrived at his parents home on the 23rd of December.  The house was brightly decorated inside and out, and it smelled of cooking  - you know how it smells when there are several types of food layered on top of another - but it just smells like home?  Yes, like that.  Everyone was incredibly gracious and kind, and I made a good impression by helping with cooking, clean up, set up and just having general conversation with his family - even his allegedly racist great uncle. Oddly enough, Devan seemed angry that they were warming up to me so well, making snide comments like they liked me more than him, etc.  Often, I found myself alone with his family members while he was no where to be found, or off in a corner messing with his phone.   We left on the 28th, and had plans for a bug NYE party in the city - tickets I had paid $400 for.  He called me on NYE at 8pm (and hour AFTER he was suppose to meet me) and said that he had taken me to his family's home to see if he could get their approval before marrying me.  He SAID they were only being polite and that NO ONE actually liked me, and he was sorry, but he just couldn't be with someone that they did not approve of.  I must have cried for a week, but eventually I began to feel that he was lying because there was no way I could have misinterpreted the situation that badly for 5 whole days.  I called his mother to ask if I had left my Hermes scarf there (I knew I hadn't) and she talked my ear off for over an hour, and said how she couldn't wait until Easter so we could be together again, and that she had told Devan she couldn't wait to have a new daughter - that lying imp used his family as an excuse!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

She is a really good kid (who's kid isn't?) and we are very close.  She is a straight A student and wants to be a dentist and chose a school that has a great dental school for post-graduate studies.  Anyway the 2 weeks up to her leaving was pretty emotional and stressful.  i thought we would be having fun and taking the time we had left before college to hang out and do some things we had wanted to but never did.  I was surprised that it was the opposite of that and she wanted to spend more time with her friends and boyfriend than be at home with mom and dad.  I mean what was I thinking anyway?  I totally get that this is her last hoorah with her pals too and they are a lot of fun to hang out with.  During the day was kind of boring and she laid around a lot.  I could tell she was bored and ready to get on with her college life as work schedules, errands, family dinner, and household chores were not going to make her want to stay around all the time.  lol  So after a week of this I encouraged her to get out and see if any friends wanted to soak u the last rays of summer and she was all for it.  I came to realize that I think she felt obligated to stay home more and be in the house with us as much as possible but the time spent doing that wasn't very productive for us or her.  i want her to be happy instead of moping around feeling obligated to stay around her parents, I mean I appreciated her sentiment and she really wanted to be with us but I also think she wanted to approval to hang with her friends too.  She was much happier and we actually had much more meaningful interactions when she knew she was free to make her own decisions.  As drop off day came up we felt really good about leaving her for her new home at school.  We know she is a fully capable adult now and those last few days or week at home seeing her grow and be her own person kind of reinforced that.  I think the parents who cry alot and are way too emotional maybe never had that connection and feel that their chances are over.  I would disagree with that as I think letting your kids grow and have freedom is what they wanted all along."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer.

All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation.     Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place.

When she asked me if I wanted to move in with her, which required me to move across the country to California, I was hesitant at first but I couldn't say no. I knew that I would lose her if we tried to do a long distance relationship. She said she would support me while I find a job out in California and while that was nice, I was still very worried. What kind of person just quits their job and moves across the country? Well, I decided that since I am young to go for it. If the relationship did not work out, I always wanted to live in a warmer climate anyway. Lucky for me I ended finding a great job in my field right away and drove across the country to live with her. Our time together so far has been a dream.

Anyways, so yet again I was seeing some issues regarding my business schedule and how I could make time for family. I felt really bad, prior to working for this company my niece and I were extremely close. In fact, I practically raised her myself when her parents were not around to handle matters (things were pretty tight with them so they had to work a lot). I finally had made up my mind and firmly resolved I could not miss this. So I spoke with some of my co-workers and really, REALLY had to twist their arms about it. I didn't want to bring it up with upper-management because I knew they would react with cold disregard. In this company, your company is your personal life and if you aren't cut out for this, the door is right there. So I convinced my co-workers to cover this one project for me, it was not easy. I had to really sweeten the deal, I told each of them I would cover twice as many projects for them (if and when they needed it). I added in that whatever projected time off they had, I would take a lot of the paper work-load off their hands for them (we never REALLY get a vacation). My niece was overjoyed to see me and honestly, just that look on her face would've been worth 5X what I offered my coworkers. We celebrated not just that weekend but the following week as well. That girl is my life, I'll never be able to pass up an opportunity to be in her life again. Maybe it's time to find a new line of work.."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

Entitled cousin does not want to watch the movie that is on, I think it was Frozen, saying it is lame and is a kids movie.  She takes the remote and changes it to Game of Thrones. All the other kids are mad and complain that the show is too scary.  A tussle ensues for the remote and in the course of the wrestling, Aunts bag is knocked over and items scatter onto the floor.  My Sister comes in and tells everyone to quiet down, changes the show back to Frozen and takes the remote which makes Entitled cousin cry and scream that Nephew hit her and wants him punished. Aunt comes in and yells at Nephew that Cousin should have what she wants and for Nephew to stop being a brat. Then Aunt sees her bag knocked over and starts screaming at Nephew that he is stealing from her. She picks up her bag and says her FitBit is missing. I roll my eyes because of all the crap in that bag, how would she know immediately that her FitBit is missing. Aunt demands Nephew turns his pockets out. Nephew says he does not have her FitBit and to leave him alone. Sister tells Aunt that her Nephew does not have her FitBit and maybe she should look under the couch where her bag fell over. One of the other kids does just this and does find her FitBit. Aunt yells at Nephew saying he stowed it there for later so Sister tells Aunt that this is rediculous and it is time for them to leave."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

Another interesting thing is that I realized how many of the people in my college that I got to know over my four years. I recognized almost every name. I didn't go to the smallest school, so this was a pretty cool realization. Everyone's favorite teacher was reading out the names, so that made it a lot better, too. After the ceremony, my family and I were so tired from the day's events that we just wanted to go home. A lot of people went out to fancy restaurants to eat, but I just wanted to go to my favorite sandwich shop at home. After returning home, I took a much-needed nap.

As a healer in my guild, she healed me when we did raid dungeons, because she was assigned to my group. There were times that we would privately whisper to each other and talk about various things in life during these gaming events, and we found that were very interested in what we had to say, and listen. It was then we I made the decision to ask her out online, not knowing to where it would lead later. We \"online dated\" for a good while, until she asked me to come see her in her country. It is very far away, but I thought, yes, I need to meet this person, so I decided to do it! Afterwards we set a date, budget, flight plans, etc. Then, I embarked on a 30 hour trip to see this person. It was a pretty good trip overall, but when I landed the airport was very packed and I felt overwhelmed how many people were there. I ended up getting lost there in the sea of people. I did meet her and her brother there, but then I had to go back into the airport to use the restroom since our plane was flying over the airport for some time.

So when we went to eat ramen and play mini-golf  with a group of our friends not much happen. At ramen I wasn't able to sit next to her, but at mini-golf we were joking around with each other. Later we all went to the bars and as the night progressed we were holding hands and hugging.

Basically the next day we did the same things: ate with a group of people, played games, and went out to the bars.

I was sure she was going to reject me and things would be awkward but instead she said she liked me too and that I should've asked her out earlier.

I planned her party at the orphanage, where she spent a majority of the last year volunteering and reading to the children. These kids, oh my gosh, the bond Alana has with them is amazing!

Her health had been in decline for years so while it wasn't unexpected it was still difficult. After she lost the ability to walk to diabetes we moved her to a nearby nursing home that specialized in employing caretakers that spoke our native language. There weren't many choices and my father worked hard to get her into this particular one which was highly regarded in the community. We visited her at least once and often two or three times a week to bring her meals to help her adjust. Unfortunately she never quite adjusted to the loss of freedom and autonomy. This went on for about four years and despite how routine it was every visit was different. Sometimes she'd have conflicts with other residents and sometimes with nurses and caretakers. She changed rooms five times during her stay which I believe was more than anyone else has. Every attempt to make things better seemed to have made some things worse. I simultaneously feared going back every week and got terribly anxious being away. Probably the biggest challenge was getting her to eat enough. She hated the food so we tried to bring her home cooked meals as often as we could but this only made her dislike the nursing home's food even more. We kept her fridge fully stocked at all times but because she hated the nursing home food so much she felt the need to save food from home for a later time. Early this year after a particularly bad illness she stopped eating altogether and had to be forced. She passed away a few months after that. She was hospitalized to find the issue and when they found cancer in her liver they determined that there was nothing they could do. We visited more often for a few weeks before that and we were with her when she passed. It shocked me how quickly everyone expected to act. The funeral was arranged within the next half hour and the nursing home pressed us to clean out the room. The wake and funeral came quick and everyone in our small family that didn't seem to care much until now seemed to care a lot. My grandmother's sister brought many strangers from her church, and the majority of people who attended were strangers. I'm still not sure how to feel about the whole ordeal.

I remember playing monopoly with him, going to the park, he even took us on dates with him and the woman he would marry. Last year I was told via facebook that he went to the hospital with pneumonia. I was worried but I assumed he'd be ok, because it's not like that's uncommon, and if he's at the hospital he'd be fine. But then my dad called the next day and told me they found spots in his lungs. Then they said it was cancer. Apparently it started in his kidney and had already spread all over his body. It was also in his brain and some other places. Then I was really terrified. I bought a plane ticket home but when I landed I checked my phone and my dad had called. I listened to the message and he said my uncle had had cardiac arrest and died.

As I looked down at what my phone said, I let out a soft curse word out of frustration.  It was still calling for a 60% chance of rain.  My fiance woke up asking what was wrong.  I told her, and she said it was okay.  We had made alternate plans just in case this were to happen.  My fiance got out of bed and kissed me.  She proceeded to calmly get ready for the day as I continued pacing nervously.  It stopped raining about 30 minutes before it was time for us to leave.  I looked at my fiance with hopeful eyes praying that the rain would hold for a couple of hours.  We hopped into my car and began driving towards our destination.  As we got closer to our destination I could begin to see a patch of blue sky begin to form from the surrounding gray spots.  We finally arrived at the waterfall, and the preacher was there waiting for us.  My fiance's eyes lit up at the site.  She had always wanted to be married by a waterfall.  It was a short ceremony but one that would forever change our lives.  Today was the day that I married the love of my life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

However, I see cars as a tool for transportation. It can be done without it. My plan was to do this until the semester ended. I had Two campuses to visit in order to follow lectures and taking tests. The journey began with a trip to the closest campus. It was six miles away. The following day followed with a trip that was eleven miles a way.  Both were doable for me but as time followed, my body was could not keep up with the work that was required to keep commuting on foot. There was many generous rides. I met new people and was able exchange phone numbers although I never called them back after the ride. Two months in and I had suffered enormous pain. I decided to take the bike for the longer commute and run as usual on the shorter route.  During the period in which I experienced the most pain, I decided to eat more of real food and avoid the junk. I also switched from sleeping on my bed to the direct floor as my back was always hurting from the weight of my bag. At the end of my semester, I did not learn anything.

The units began to hold alot of matter that clogs the drain up, that don't allow for adequate flow of any moisture that forms.

Other than that, a lot of the time was just spent waiting. It made my husband and I feel sad because our son was hungry but he was not allowed to eat prior to the surgery. Thankfully the hospital did have a good amount of toys that helped keep him distracted. Finally around 12:30 in the afternoon he was taken back for his surgery. My husband and I were not allowed to go back with him, but the nurses and doctors made it fun for him by taking him back in a big push car. Once they got to the room, they put a small mask on his face with the strawberry scented gas he had picked out earlier. After he was asleep with the gas, they put the needle in his hand for the other anesthesia. Surgery only lasted about one hour. The nurse came to get my husband and I to take us to where our son was recovering. He's normally a really happy little guy, but unfortunately he was in a lot of pain and very confused coming out of his surgery. He ended up needing three shots of morphine in his IV to manage the discomfort. Thankfully it seemed to work quickly and soon we were on our way home. He seems to be recovering well and we're thankful his surgery was an over-all uneventful, yet memorable, experience."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

There is a pier and a long jetty alongside it that leads to a lighthouse. It was a very dark night and you could see the lights of the port and the homes shimmering on the hillside, but it was so dark that you could not readily identify the people that were walking along the pier. As we were walking along the pier, I could see the bonfires on the nearby beach, it was a surreal look because of the contrast of color due to the darkness around us. There were occasional fireworks shooting off from a park above on the nearby hillside as well, it all gave me a surreal feeling, the colors clashed and really created a festival like atmosphere. I also saw the colors of the fishermen's lures on the water, people walking along the shore with the light from their phones visible, I heard music in the distance. It was a unique type of night. I would talk about the things going on with my family and how this was such a unique experience. The most memorable part however was when a large cruise ship came into harbor. It was off in the distance and got larger and larger until in entered the harbor. The various lights of the ship were glistening, it's reflection on the water lit up the whole area.

I got my husband back from a long deployment. This event was so memorable because of our son and how excited he was. It was also very emotional because we had been apart for so long. I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and I had my family back together. The feelings I felt that whole day up until seeing him is just something I could never forget. He was supposed to come home a few days before but it got changed and it was so frustrating. His new time was going to be two in the morning and I remember being so exhausted. I woke my son up literally as I was walking out the door. He was such a trooper, while we waited for daddy he played with a little American flag and just crawled around. The second we seen him I started crying, and my son could not stop starring at him. I was so nervous about how our son was going to react to him. He was so young when he left and now almost a year old and had established fears. He was very nervous around men since he was not around many with his father being gone. But he went to his daddy like he knew exactly who he was and nothing made me happier than that moment.  We have been through deployments before but this was our first one with a child. This was a whole different experience that you could only understand if you have been through it. I am so thankful for my husband and everything he does for our family. Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling. Seeing his face when he picked up our son just put me completely his shoes and made me realize how much he is sacrificing. He missed six months of his child's life, I could not imagine. This was for sure an evening I will never forget and always cherish."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

In the afternoons we enjoyed playing board games and sometimes took a nap. In the evenings we would make a scrumptious dinner, return to stroll along the water while watching the sunsets, and then again to the hot tub with a glass of wine.

This last July the band reformed and traveled to Bogota, Colombia to play a show. It was fun and a bit surreal to reunite and work with the other members after all the time off. It was also pretty humorous to see how quickly we all settled in to our old behaviors. Traveling as a group can be stressful especially when you have to transport instruments that the TSA views with suspicion and attempts to disassemble, which is what happened to me. Thankfully I was able to get everything working for the concert.  We had a full day in Bogota before the show, which we spent hanging out with a promoter with whom we had worked before on a previous trip. He took us to local restaurants and record stores which we never would have stumbled on by ourselves. Then that evening there was a party at a record store in kind of a hipster area of town. After that we headed to a small jazz club where the drummer from the band we were sharing the bill with was playing. It was a small cafe with a prominently displayed triptych of chairman Mao. There are very good painters in Bogota and there are very elaborate murals to be seen everywhere and even the graffiti approaches high art. The show was a double bill with another band and took place in a very large 5000 seat auditorium, even though neither band had the capacity to draw that many people. Even though the whole organization was very professionally run, sound check seemed to last forever and resulted in my not being able to have lunch with an old friend who I hadn't seen for years. But the concert itself went well there was a good showing on the ground floor seats, but the balconies remained unused. Afterwards I was able to meet up with my friend and go out for some drinks. The day after the show was spent in the studio collaborating with the band with whom we had shared the bill, and felt like equal parts work and social occasion. Some friends of the other band who are foodie types, prepared a meal for everyone, and there was plenty of beer and wine and general frivolity. Our last day in Bogota was open so the guitarist and keyboardist and I went to the National museum, which is a sprawling, long and narrow building with lots of interactive exhibits on everything about Colombian culture past and present.

She has had a few health scares and it was really good that she could attend and be a part of the festivities.

Once we checked into the hotel, we immediately headed back out to explore the city. Each day we sought to explore a different borough. We checked out Central Park and the zoo. We of course visited Lady Liberty herself and the One World Trade Center. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and took pictures of the water. We took the subway to Coney Island and rode on the ferris wheel until sunset. We walked down Wall Street and watched all the bankers and brokers run from office to office. We spent about a week there and we still felt like we hadn't seen half of what the city has to offer but all in all it was still the most amazing trip we've ever taken and we will definitely be heading back."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

Joe's birthday was on a Wednesday so we thought we should have it the Saturday before so he would really be surprised.  A friend of Joe's volunteered to keep him busy that Saturday.  That worked out great, giving the rest of us plenty of time to get everything set up in the back room at Ike's.  We decorated a little with some sports stuff and some black balloons.  Everyone showed up around 6 and milled around til we got the news they were on the way.  As they entered the bar, the bartender greeted them loudly enough so we knew it was time.  As they entered the room, Joe's parents were the first people he saw.  Behind him were about 20 others, all yelling \"Happy Birthday Joe!\", as loud as they could.  Everyone seemed to have such a good time and Joe was totally surprised.  At one point, the singer who was working that evening came in and sang Happy Birthday to Joe and we all joined in.  After the party, Joe's Mom came to me and told me she wanted to pay for everything.  She was thrilled about the party and happy to pay for it which was not expected but was very nice.

Through our back-and-forth chats, I discovered that she was visiting her sister in a small city rather near where we were staying. Immediately, we were both enthused about the possibility of reconnecting and didn't want to miss such a surprising opportunity.

My brother and friend returned home on a flight the next day. The following day, we decided to meet at a local cafe. The cafe was a beautiful little countryside shop that was surrounded by some stunning scenery. I arrived first, but only had to wait for five minutes or so. We picked a table outside, which made for a very pleasant experience due to the lovely weather and tranquility. Somehow, despite having hardly spoken for eight years aside from a message or two, we reconnected so easily. Our conversation wasn't the least bit awkward or stilted even at the beginning and we fell back into a sort of easygoing, lighthearted rhythm remarkably naturally. After a small lunch, we spent the rest of the day traveling by train through the countryside. We talked and laughed and shared numerous stories about our lives over the years. Nothing felt difficult to talk about and the depth of our friendship seemed to have never left, as though it would be able to survive anything. We said goodbye to each other that night, but met up again two days afterward and spent the majority of my remaining time there together. Aside from the reformation of a wonderful friendship, the whole experience was one of the most transformative of my life.

Instead of going to get my pickup truck registration renewed on time or, heaven forbid, early, I dawdled around until the last minute and then managed to FORGET the deadline entirely! End result: my sad truck failed to pass the required emissions test. No big deal, right? Not unless I want to drive the truck anywhere.

For starters, new catalytic converters are crazy expensive. Second, you can hack almost anything with the right know-how and equipment ( which almost always includes aluminum foil). It pays to have friends who know stuff. They don't go out of their way to tell you but if you fail, you get one do-over, for FREE! Provided you can find a repair shop that offers one. That involves looking for a teeny-tiny official-looking sticker in the corner of an often very dirty window. So once you find this mechanical get-out-of jail-free card, you still have to pass the test. That's where friends who know stuff come in. The same three things kept coming up:  tires, oil, cold air. That's the ingredients to the motoring magic elixir: Make sure you have your tires at the proper pressure: make sure you have fresh, clean oil: go when they first open so your car is warm and the air temperature is cooler. The hotter the day, the more chance of coughing out some of the bad stuff. Armed with my new oil and freshly-fluffed tires, I was waiting at the bay door when the service center opened for the day. Fifteen easy-peasy minutes later I was motoring on my way to the license bureau with my A-plus grade emission sticker in hand.  The surly, scowling DMV wizards stamped my registration paperwork and now I can legally and safely travel the highways and byways for two more years before I have to go through this process all over again.

I met many interesting managers, owners and employees in many of them, but the most memorable to me was with a man who was Sales Director at first, and is now one of the owners of a gallery in Chelsea.  I went to his gallery 5 or 6 times, but it was not only because I liked the painters he represented, but because I enjoyed talking and playing nice and sophisticated verbal 'games' with him.  He was very engaging as I talked to him about recommending some of one of his artists'  paintings to my sister, a collector, but even before that e discussed ballet because of one of the paintings that included a ballet  dancer, about which I am very knowledgeable.  He is not quite a close friend yet, but I was very impressed with his graceful technique, which most with the purpose of selling do not do nearly that well, so it looks like it will be something to look forward to in the coming months and years since I live close by and can go there often. Once there were some poster-type paintings, one of which included the George Bernard Shaw quote \"If you say something cannot be done, do not interrupt those who are doing it\".  I told him about how funny I thought it was, and this was a kind of teasing that he responded to, understanding me completely.  That was the second time I went to that gallery, mostly to see what had changed from coming early.  He is a very experienced gallerist, and always patiently took time with the two artists I settled on, the two who interested me and who interested my sister, who is a collector.  I found out she was interested in these works from an attachment he sent me, there were two abstract painters from which she might still choose to have in her home in Georgia.  He then extended the invitation to me and her alike to visit the favourite painter's studio in New Jersey when she is ready for purchase.  She comes to town once or twice a year, so she was excited that we would be able to do this.  She has outlined her preference in colour to narrow it down for what works best in her home.  I stay in touch with him about this eventuality, which may not happen due to family health problems till spring, but I also just go over and visit with him to see what new work he is showing and talk to him about art in general.  It's a good physical exercise (the gallery is a little over a mile walk for me), and he is always funny and generous about giving me more information on the artists. So we may actually become real friends over the next few months.  I enjoyed meeting someone by chance like this whom I truly liked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

It started off like we expected: my wife went into labor, we waited until the contractions were getting closer and then we headed for the hospital.  I thought everything seemed like it was going as planned but as I quickly learned, complications can happen suddenly.  As we were walking into the hospital my wife suddenly loss consciousness and I happened to catch her just as she was about to fall to the floor.  As the nurses rushed to her aid I was in shock of what was happening.  This couldn't possibly be normal.  Everything seemed to be in slow motion.  She was put on a stretcher, rushed to a room and I followed behind helplessly and numb from what was happening.  After the doctor arrived and several checks were done he explained that my wife was having some sort of complications, her airflow was being restricted and they needed to do emergency surgery to deliver our baby.  After everything was prepared I was allowed to stay by her side and watch as the doctor started the c-section to deliver our baby.  As he was doing the procedure he noticed what the issue was.  According to him, scar tissue from a previous surgery had attached itself to the underside of one side of her lung and the combination of that and the baby putting pressure on her organs had caused her to lose consciousness.  He said he'd never seen something like that happen but was expecting the pressure to be relieved once his procedure was finished.  Several minutes later I was able to hold our baby for the first time and shortly after that my wife woke from the procedure.

I took the job right out of college and thought it would be great. It was a huge company so I knew my job would be stable, and if I wanted to move around a bit I figured that I would be able to. Well, after 4 years of small raises and no real big opportunities, I decided that it was time to chase my passion and look for new work about 3 months ago. I was such a small cog in this company since it was massive so I felt that my work was not meaningful. A family friend of mine had recently started a job in sales at a very small board company responsible for some big hit games, and they were looking to fill out their accounting department. Taking this job would be a risk, but board gaming is something I am passionate about and this company was so small. Anything I did in that job would be noticed by everyone. I would be making a real impact in my work. I decided to throw caution to the wind, and apply for the job. I've now been here for 2 months and I love it.

I remember when I grew up, my family always had dogs and puppy around because we had such huge farm at the time. The most dogs we had at the time were 5 and they were all extremely attached me because I really enjoyed taking care of them and vice versa. It was even hard taking care of them with my family\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s help back then.  At this stage of my life, I want to take a big step of adopting my very first puppy, all on my own. I feel I am ready for this huge responsibility to take care of another life. I started looking for a breeder because I specifically want a Chocolate Labrador Retriever. I found a reputable breeder and she said she would put me on the waiting list and let me know when her dog got pregnant. Fast forward until 5 months ago, best news ever, the breeder called me that her dog delivered 5 beautiful and healthy babies and one of them could be mine. I was filled with joyed and immediately asked if I could visit them. The mama dog and the puppies were beautiful and of courses I picked out a male Choc Lab . I followed up every week and 3 months later, he was ready to go home with me. When I arrived and saw him, I busted out with tears and couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t believe that he was mine. He is beautiful and no words can describe how happy I was and I still am. Every time I see my puppy, I recall the first moment I met him when he was tiny little pup and now, he grows so fast. He is so playful, eats a lot but not food aggressive because dog come from big litter can become food aggressive due to the nature of surviving instinct. He fills my day with happiness, he cheers me up after a long day at work. Cleaning after him is very exhausting but looking at those puppy eyes, I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t complain. He loves bath, I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t believe it. Most dogs hate it, and my dog enjoys it, it makes my life so much easier to bath him during these summer months because he is so actively. I have to say I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made one of the best decisions of my life by adopting my first puppy, and I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll need to adopt another so that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll can become best friends and do not feel lonely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

I took a week off to drive to the park, and to set up the campsite that I have reserved. The memorable moment of this trip would be when I was hiking in upper Yellowstone. After seeing several geysers, such as Old Faithful, I also wanted to go on some hikes and trails, specifically in Lamar Valley near the northeast entrance. It was in the afternoon, and I had already been able to experience and observe many bison and wildlife that I had normally never seen in the wild, only through pictures or a zoo setting. Seeing the wildlife in person, and often much closer than I would have preferred was a great experience in its own right, more so as I would recollect incidents of wildlife attacking people for venturing too close to them. Keeping my distance as much as I could on the trail, I kept on walking, taking in the scenery and occasionally getting wet from the occasional rain that basked the area. After walking for a bit, I would eventually come across an animal I had hoped to come across, but in person would fill me with fear and awe. A large bear ended up walking near the trail, a bear that had notably brown fur. I had previously encountered several black bears in my life, a couple even as I was driving in Yellowstone, but not this type of bear much less this close up. It was no doubt a grizzly bear, evident by its pronounced hump in its back, a feature not commonly shared with other bears. The distance between me and the bear no doubt put me in notable danger, although the bear was evidently focused on other things, likely foraging for food given the time of day. I attempted to remember all the advice and information I read about dealing with grizzly bears, such as not making sudden movements such as running away. Staying in place yet making my presence known, the bear would eventually walk away from the trail, ending any potential danger from the confrontation. Despite the danger, I was glad to experience and photograph up close a grizzly bear, given how synonymous it is to the park, and even the state I traveled from. It would have been possible that I could hike in Yellowstone for hours on end, even days and not come across a grizzly bear, at any distance given timing or even luck. For this encounter, I am fortunate to experience an aspect of nature that reminds me of nature's beauty and majesty, along with its danger and potential risk."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

She was given three months to live and a very high certainty of mortality in that time frame, no matter the treatment. Mom's a fighter, so she decided to live those three months as honestly and fully as possible. She moved in with us so she could spend more time with my wife, my daughter and I. It was controversial but she decided against chemo or other treatment so she could enjoy her time. In the first month we traveled to Kauai and Peru, two places she had always wanted to go, but most importantly we walked to daycare to drop off my daughter after laughing through breakfast, watched crappy gameshows and silly movies, and played games. By month two she had lost her ability to really move around, and 60 days later, she passed in her sleep. The honest and tender moments we spent together in her last days have shown me the most important words in life are, \"I love you.\" I will never forget the time we spent together. My daughter will always have cherished memories of grandma, her last picture taken was at Pfeiffer park in Big Sur, snuggling with her. Sometimes life puts crises in your path to learn a hard lesson.

Since we have no kids of our own, we dressed our child-like dolls in their finest embellished tweed jumpsuits and packed them into the back of my 1975 Cutlas Supreme, and away we sped to a very fine dining experience, and nothing more...

After situating our child-like dolls on either side of us, and just as I was about to sit, I heard a boisterous commotion and witnessed the waitstaff cascading away in a choreographed series of movements to reveal my entire extended family doing a Russian dance routine and singing Happy Birthday! To me! What a perfect performance! What a perfect way to celebrate another year. Seeing their smiling face-- little Susie, little Tyler, fat Charlie-- it sent chills down my spine. We asked the waiters to push some tables together. I couldn't wait for the gifts, so I didn't let anyone eat until after my presents were opened.

I'm usually a night person but I was set my alarm for 8 AM, excited for our shower to finally be repaired.

About 3 years ago we let one of my fiance's friends he's had since high school stay with us. There was no bedroom available, so he made a room for himself out of furniture and bedsheets in the large 'man cave' that is adjacent to the living room. I was slightly apprehensive about it because I knew he was a little moody at times, but agreed because he was our friend and would be paying us $200 in rent per month. For the first year or so things were going nicely, we were all happy (as far as I know), and friendly. Spending time together, helping each other out when needed, etc. But as time went on, our friend/roommate became more miserable. His job started early, so he wanted to come home and take naps at 3-4 in the afternoon, and that is a difficult thing to do when you are in a room made out of sheets, and there are two toddler boys in the next room. Also, the boys and I are always home, because I cannot drive, we live on a highway so it's not safe to walk anywhere, and my fiance is always at work, so it was like this every day. I don't work because daycare in the area I live for 2 toddlers cost more than what I made at my job! So this was happening every day. In addition to that, our friends would come over and stay late, and they were his friends too. Usually 1 to 2 times per week. So I guess he wasn't getting enough sleep. I say I guess, because this man, in addition to being moody, is very passive aggressive. So instead of talking to us about his issues, he would just walk by in silence, ignore me if I said hello to him, and just generally be bitter. He wasn't like that all the time though. Sometimes he would be like that, and just a few hours later be kind and talkative. So over time, he became more and more bitter and confusing, helping us out like friends less and less, and isolating himself more and more. And was friendly mostly when he was drunk. Eventually he started blaming me for my children being loud in the day, and even telling them to shut the f--- up sometimes! So about two weeks ago the situation came to its head, and my fiance had it. He told him that he has been mean to us and our children, a bad friend, and that he needs to move out. It is sad, because they have been friends since they were 15, and I know he will hold animosity towards us.

Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women. I was felt some pain in the armpits or breast that does not change with the monthly cycle. Also pitting or redness of the skin of the breast, similar to the surface of an orange. A rash around or on one of the nipples and discharge from a nipple, possibly containing blood. So I confirmed that I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor will check the breasts for lumps and other symptoms. Several tests can help detect breast cancer as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The main treatment are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, biological therapy, or targeted drug therapy, hormone therapy. But  I had chemo, surgery and radiation as treatment. If surgery is necessary, the type will depend on both the diagnosis and individual preference. A lumpectomy can help prevent the spread of the cancer. This may be an option if the tumor is small and easy to separate from its surrounding tissue.  A simple mastectomy involves removing the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, nipple, areola, and some skin. In some types, a surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes and muscle in the chest wall. A person may undergo radiation therapy around a month after surgery. Radiation involves targeting the tumor with controlled doses of radiation that kill any remaining cancer cells. A doctor may prescribe cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs to kill cancer cells if there is a high risk of recurrence or spread. When a person has chemotherapy after surgery, doctors call it adjuvant chemotherapy. Sometimes, a doctor may choose to administer chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor and make its removal easier. Doctors call this neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

We have had a pretty incredible relationship, obviously not perfect but we always come out of situations on top, together.

We very much wanted to take our time getting to know one another and just enjoying our lives together. Earlier this year, I decided I wanted to propose on our two year anniversary, and I started getting things set up to do so. I picked out the ring with the help of her sister, who is her best friend, and got on with planning the proposal. I decided the most important place to us would be the perfect place to propose, and that's at a local park where we shared our first kiss. In order to ensure that she didn't suspect anything, I had her sister suggest to her that we go on a double picnic date in that park with her and her husband before we went for our anniversary dinner alone later that night. We would then take some photos together as a group and just the two of us. Since she believed it was her sister's idea, my girlfriend suspected absolutely nothing. When it came time, my girlfriend's sister suggested that my girlfriend and I pose for a couples photo, and as we were stood next to each other, I stepped back, got down on one knee and proposed. She was shocked and overjoyed, and after realizing what was happening, jumped into my arms and said yes.

After a few days of lending him the money, that nice old lady who had met and liked me so much, began to change his way of being with me.

So days and days went by until I took on the task of inquiring if she really had used that for her mortgage, the truth was that no, I spend it on something I still don't know. Seeing this, I went to her house and argued with her I was so upset that I could not even think, I felt so deceived, and I told her that I was going to report her to pay me the money. It was a very tense moment. Until she confezo me it was my grandmother, that grandmother who had believed missing since long ago, that grandmother since childhood so much wanted to have and now hate her for having deceived, that grandmother tricky and very unethical.

As soon as we lifted off the pilot said we would be landing in Los Angeles at about 8:05 pm.  At that moment, my heart sank and I realized I was on the wrong plane.  Once we landed in Los Angeles I went to explain what happened and to catch the next flight to Vegas.  The lady at the desk then told me the next flight was in two hours to Las Vegas and they had two seats available that the cost would be $650. 00.  I finally made it to Vegas and had a good time.  It was a simple misunderstanding that could have been solved quickly but the airline didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seem to care that I was late and had less money to spend on my vacation because of their mistake.  Had their computers been working this wouldn't have happened.  I would have arrived in Vegas on time and my friends wouldn't have had to worry.  I found a different airline to fly home.  I didn't feel I could trust the one who put me on the wrong plane. At least my luggage was a carry on and it didn't get lost.

We had a lot in common so we continued to hang out at a local bar and dance club into the wee hours of the evening. He told me his car was in the shop and asked if I could drop him off at his home. I agreed naively, assuming this guy was telling me the truth. He said he did not want to sleep with me on the first night because he is a traditional dude. 'Once we arrived at his house we started to make out in the car in front of his home.  By the time we were done I saw little hands hitting my passenger side car window. There was a small child calling me a tramp and telling me not to kiss his father. I asked him what was going on and he said I was not supposed to find out like this. I replied, \"Like what?\" He then said he forgot to mention that he had a wife and a family. He wanted to ask me without all the drama if I would be complicit in being his girlfriend though.

I told them that I was going to train a little first by swimming in a pool every day for a few months before I attempt surfing. So, I did. Most of my friends surf, and some are excellent at it. This particular weekend they all got together, found a board for me, and took me to the beach since the waves were not too rough on that day, and perfect for a beginner. They were all trying to explain to me what I needed to do, and then they finally made me go out into the waves and try it. The experience was amazing. I was shocked that I got up onto the board on my first attempt. I certainly did not expect that. The feeling of gliding on the wave is difficult to describe. I surfed with my friends for the better part of the morning, until I was exhausted. This was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I will never forget the wonder I felt on the first surfing day of my life. I am hoping that surfing will now become a regular part of my life. I already love water, and now I can incorporate into my love of water. Surfing immediately became one of my favorite sports. Instant love affair.

So I sat there, looking at Facebook, thinking about how the last time I left I didn't know it was going to be the last time.

A male passenger across from me kept cursing during his phone conversation.  The bus driver had no qualms with correcting the young man's outbursts.  Later during the drive, the bus driver attempted her best to not doze off.  During the last leg of the trip she swerved a few times. To keep herself awake, she started to hum.  The bus driver hummed louder and louder as we progressed closer and closer to the bus/train station.  I was amused to the point of giggling.  My daughter was not.  My daughter didn't get much sleep the night before our trip, and she had hoped she would make up for it during our bus ride.  When my daughter and I ended our bus trip and arrived in Indiana, we experienced a dull four hour layover.  Maybe it was dull because it was the wee-hours of the morning.  But she and I amused ourselves by cracking jokes and making silly comments. After the long four hours, we finally boarded the train and had begun our cozy and adventurous ride to Utah.  Our first stop was in Chicago.  My daughter and I had to transfer ourselves and our luggage to another train.  The customer service gentleman who assisted us with the transfer was kind, comedic and inquisitive.  He and I exchanged jests and sarcasms after he made an inquiry concerning our reasons for going to Utah.  The customer service gentleman also joked about the size of my daughter's luggage.

She started to  have major anxiety due to the small space and pulled out the bottle and took a drink.  We all then took a drink and another and within in a few minutes we started feeling goofy and relaxed.  The elevator was on the outside of the building and had glass all around the backside.  You could see the pool area and the the elevators right next to us.  There were three  guys in the elevator to our right.  They were stuck also.  They couldn't hear us and we just tried to communicate with hand signals.  They were laughing and having as much fun as we were.  We couldn't wait to get out of the elevator and hang out with them at the pool.    Before we knew it we were engaged in a game of charades with the guys next to us.  It made it more fun because we could only communicate with body language and trying to read lips.  I don't think we ever laughed so hard.

Needless to say the elevators started moving again and my friends and I continued hanging out with the guys down at the pool.

How they started dating and ended up together and after having a child of their own, they now wanted to adopt another child. I remember my eyes starting to get watery because this was a beautiful story and I asked myself If I could see myself adopting a child. Having a child and adopting one and caring and loving him as if he was my own. Caring and loving him as much as I love and care for my own child, and to be honest I couldn't get myself to answer the question. I was dealing with depression, feeling alone and left out so I decided to leave this question to answer another day. This was 10 years ago. I have told my girlfriend this story before and about five months ago, she surprised me with taking about wanting to adopt a child. This honestly brought me to tears and to be honest at this point in time, I have never loved her more. We have had some rough patches between us in the past but I think that has all settled now. This is not an easy decision, infact its nerve wracking but I hope we will get through with it. This was five months ago and we are now going through the process of adopting a child.

Our research was going well and we were meeting deadlines. The day that changed my life started as any other day at work. I was told there would be an impromptu meeting at the end of the day but that wasn't anything out of the norm. Unfortunately, I could not stay for the meeting as my 4 year old had swim practice on Wednesday evenings and I came in early to be able to take her.

I had to do it . After fighting with the town about they said I would be have to do it so I prepared all materials and got a friend to help me dig. It was a big project and was about 125 feet of area. I bought the pipes at  special store. I needed 10 foot hard plastic pipes about 3.5 inch diameter. Needed a friend with a van to get them.  Then We proceeded to dig down about two feet down thru all kinds of junk rocks roots etc. First part was from a central point that water went into and then the difficult part came  I had to go under a sidewalk. Thought this would be easy but was impossible till my 82 year old neighbor came over with two massive crowbar pipes and the three of us actually took out that piece of sidewalk  It was very hard and heavy. Then the last 70 feet was a straight run. The town had made a connection point for me so all I needed was to connect the two after much digging . The connection needed a special joint so it was off to the store. All the while had to put up tape and stakes to prevent people from going there It looked horrible. Now all connections were made and needed to concrete over the connection in the starting point which again my neighbor helped. He was great and knew how to do everything including pitch which was important so then we made some adjustments and finally filled in all the stuff. All this work by my 82 year old was surprising because he acted like he was 40. Not possible to accomplish this without him . Filled in the area with dirt and had a friend bring over new dirt to fill in some spots. Then the job was to spread grass seed and cover and wait for the grass to grow. Finally had to appear in court because the work was delayed util I could get help. I had to pay a fine for the violation of town ordinance in the first place.

While I was very concerned about giving an anti-depressant to a 19 year old child, we were kinda at our wit's end.  Living with her had gotten to the point that the entire house was on edge.  She was either asleep or yelling at us or ignoring us or being rude and nasty to every person in the house.    So the event I'm talking about happened about 6 weeks after she started taking the medication.  One day I realized that she'd come home from work and we'd had a 20 minute conversation in which she was lively, animated, and actually laughed.  I started realizing that she wasn't near as rude or mean or nasty as she used to be.  When I asked her to take out the trash, she just did it.  Without arguing, without putting it off and then forgetting, without any complaining, this was unheard of.  I was praising God and thanking Him for the nudge to try the medication with her.  It has changed her world, and therefore ours as well.  Recently she received word that although she got into her favorite college, she would not be able to go as the cost of room and board was just too much and we didn't feel like she should be drowning in student loan debt.  She was understandably upset but after about 10 minutes she started making other plans that involve living at home and going to a great school locally.  This would have never happened before the medication.  She would have retreated to her room and been in there for days, it would have crushed her, ruined her life in her eyes, and caused such upheaval that it would have taken weeks if not more for her to get back to baseline.

Also, my sister has hardwood floors in her bedroom.  I have carpeted.  My thought it that my puppy liked the feel of the cold hardwood floors at night.  I'm under the impression that the carpet may have been slightly uncomfortable until my puppy got used to the temperature difference.  To test this theory, I bought a big piece of tile and put it at the foot of my bed.  Like the hardwood, the tile would stay cool overnight.  The very first night with the tile, it seemed like my puppy slept easier and didn't wake me up in the middle of the night.  My theory had been correct.  My puppy was to hot laying on the carpet because she already has long hair.  With the tile, it gave her a nice cool surface to relax on.  I'm not positive if this had anything to do with her eating and bathroom habbits though.  She ate very little and subsequently had to go the bathroom very little for the first week.  I'm not sure if she wasn't taking well to the environment change.  Potentially she had a specific routine of which she would go the bathroom at my sisters and had specific landmarks she associated with her location.

I put this in the backyard to my house and in just two days, my puppy's mood seemed to elevate.

It was a Tuesday around 4 PM.  I saw a little dog in the distance wandering along the side of the road.  The traffic wasn't very heavy yet, but it's tourist season so I knew it would pick up soon.  I pulled over and walked up to the little guy.  I was hoping that he had a tag on him with his address so I could just walk him home.  He didn't have a collar on at all, probably got hung up on something then he slipped it off.  He was kind of scraggly, unkempt and looked like he was starving.  Luckily I had a sandwich I had picked up for later in the saddlebag.  He was really friendly, like he had a good home at some point.  Wasn't aggressive at all, just being happy to have something to eat.  I couldn't really tell what breed he was but he was some kind of hound mix.  While he happily followed me I knocked on the doors of the few houses that were near to see if he was anyone's pet.  Of course, nobody could claim him.  I knew if he were left alone it was a matter of time before he got hit by a car.  I asked an elderly gentleman if the dog could stay in his garage until I got my bike back home and could come back with a car.  He agreed and that's how I ended up with a new dog.  Frank is his name and he's sleeping on his bed happily in my office behind me at this moment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

I got it after the $1000 clunker I bought in high school died on me.  Having a mechanic glance at it would have cost more than it was worth. I went around looking for a newish used car, but I had bad credit from some delinquent bills from college.  Most places wouldn't finance a car without a HUGE down payment.  I was just out of college and had no money and only an entry-level job.  Billy Bob's Used Cars said that they would finance anyone.  The cars in Billy Bobs had the monthly payments stickered onto their windshields.  The prices were less than I'd seen elsewhere.  I was really stressed out about the whole situation.  I was stupid and I rushed through the whole process and didn't carefully read the sales contract.  In the fine print was a little mention of this thing called a \"balloon payment.\"  At the end of the loan, i was expected to pay a lump sum of $1200.  That was why the payments were so reasonable. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and the state Department of Consumer Affairs, but they both said that, while rare, car financing with a balloon payment was legal.  Just because the dealership failed to mention the final payment verbally doesn't mean that there's anything actionable in the agreement because there it was in writing.  I think the dealer and other dealers take advantage of the fact that some people just want to get the odious process over and done with as quickly as possible.  It is just an embarrassing episode that I don't like to talk about. I have better credit now, so my bank kindly gave me a loan on the equity of my now 6 year old car.

I also needed to stop being overly sensitive about perceived slights from her when, according to her, there were none. I didn't know it at the time but she was totally gaslighting me. The last thing she wanted was an honest heart-to-heart talk. In the last few months the situation had gotten much worse. It turned out she had been having an affair with a good friend of mine for over two years. She swore how that one affair was all there was and that it was now over.

The neighborhood dogs tend to spend the days visiting each other and ... being dogs. Most of them go back to the particular human family that \"owns them\" at night to be fed and cared for, but there are always a few that don't seem to belong to anyone in particular and just sort of make the rounds between a few different homes.

He had been found under a nearby house when the homeowners investigated the source of a whimpering noise they had been hearing for a few days. Apparently there was a thorn in his foot that had become badly infected, and these people (not having money for veterinary care, nor desiring to have a dog) had him taken to the shelter. Well, I had always been rather fond of Rufus in passing. So when my wife suggested we cover the cost of his antibiotics and adopt him I agreed. A couple weeks of healing and good food and he was back to his rascally good nature. However, now that we \"owned\" him on paper problems began to arise. You see, my wife and I live on the edge of town and coyotes live in the valley below us. They don't really cause any trouble in town, but they are the reason that most farmers in the area have a dog to scare them away from livestock. It used to be that when the coyotes would start \"singing\" at night several of the town dogs would \"rap battle\" right back. A territory thing I suppose ... Well, Rufus in particular had always seemed to see it as part of his oikos to protect the smaller dogs and bark loudly to keep the coyotes at bay. Nobody ever seemed to mind, but once he became \"our\" dog that changed. Neighbors began to call the police with noise complaints. They demanded that we keep him in the house at night. Now, he was a very sweet dog, obedient to many commands like sit, shake, Eskimo Kiss, etc. but being rather a free spirit the one thing he would not do is come when he was called. He would come close enough to \"check in\" but not quite into arms reach until he was good and ready. Well, after a few more exchanges with the cops we started keeping him tied up with a cable when he went out so we could make sure that he came inside at night. Well, one night the local pack of coyotes were raising a right ruckus. Long story short, Rufus broke the cable and ran off to join them, I have been hearing his deep happy bark mingling with their song from the valley."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

I told her to use little memory tricks to remember different things, but the older teacher told me that the only way to be sure to pass was to learn his method and verbiage.

After half an hour we went back to tell my brother we couldnt find him. With about an hour left until wedding things became panicky. About 20 minutes later of chaos and panic we got a call from housekeeping. My brothers friend who is almost 30 years old was passed out drunk in the closet where they keep extra chairs and tables. After he was confronted he began to cry about his drinking problem. This lead to a quick chat about him and who he was and what he needed to do. We didnt have him in the wedding and just went with an uneven number of groomsmen and bridesmaid's. I havent heard from my brothers friend in awhile nor about him but it was very eye opening.

I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. But when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. It would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. Well one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. She was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. It's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken.

For the seven years prior we lived out in the country and loved our privacy. We had bonfires every fall, parties, and my kids had the woods to have adventures in. Now that we are in the city my 12 year old son has become noticeably depressed and withdrawn. He doesn't want to go outside or even come out of his room. At first I thought it might be the move, but that is not the issue.   Night before last I asked him to come in my room and have a talk. I asked what was going on with him. He sat there and began to sob and cry. Finally after a few minutes of me reassuring him that there was nothing to big or bad that we can't handle it together. What he told me completely blew my mind. He preceded to tell me about how he has always felt different and then said he felt like he was supposed to be born a girl. I tried not to let my jaw hit the floor. I asked him to elaborate and he said that he had felt that way for a long time but was afraid to say anything. He then told me that he would preferred to be called by a female version of his name and would like for us to refer to him by that name and by the pronoun she. I hugged her and told her we would do whatever we could to make her be comfortable and if that was calling her a different name or anything else that would make exploring this easier for her. Honestly it is one of the hardest things I have faced with any of my three children. I consider myself to be open-minded and progressive, but when it's your child, all of that goes out the window. I love all of my children and have always assured  them that there is nothing we can't face together. So now it's time for me to back that up with action. I want to help her be comfortable with who she is regardless of what gender she identifies with, but I at the same time my heart breaks for the painful journey that I know she faces. People are mean and while society is more accepting than it used to be, it's still scary.

As you stand in the middle of this room, you can watch a projection of the sunrise and sunset at various significant times of the year, and how it looks through the various alignments of the stones. There is a replica Neolithic village, and all of the displays are hands-on, with a knowledgeable interpreter to tell you what it is you're touching. There is a modern replica of one of the big sarcen stones, from the same quarry as the originals, on a sort of sled made of logs. It has a rope running to a meter. As you tug on the rope, it tells you how many more people you need on your rope to make the sled move. (It takes about 100 strong adults to move the sled.)The stone circle itself is both larger and smaller than I'd imagined it would be. The stones are huge, and crowded together, but the ring looks so small on the top of its hill. There is nothing around the hilltop for some distance, and the visitor center is hidden down over the edge of the hill a short distance away.  Of course, the route out of the centre back to the parking lot led through the gift shop. I resisted the impulse to pick up a \"Stonehenge ROCKS\" T-shirt. After the visit, we went to a nearby pub for lunch. I had fish and chips, and cider. It was a delightful day in a historic area of England."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

She was five years younger than me, so although we were similar in age, the things we did and who we hung out with were pretty drastically different.

It wasn't intentional in any way, but it just didnt feel like we were as close as we should have been considering we were family. That's kind of why I was a little surprised when she called me up one day to talk. I knew that she had been seeing this guy for a while now through facebook and whatnot.

I found a place, someplace gorgeous that had all the amenities I was looking for at a price I loved. In a good area, I deigned to look at what the street was called and lo and behold the house was on Aurora Lane. I knew this house was meant for me and it showed that my religion always comes though for me. I do believe there is a God up there and this experience has shown me that it is indeed the case, the way things matched up so surprisingly nicely and personally to me.

He walked with us for a bit, talking about life in general, when we spied a little creature slinking along the sidewalk.  It was curious about us, and showed absolutely no fear of my dog or us.  My friend crouched down and called to it, and it ran right to him and allowed him to pick it up.  It was a young ferret!!  The poor little guy was fully tame and wanted human attention.  We figured that it must be lost, and I agreed to take it in while we asked around and checked the papers and social media to find it's owner.  Later that day, I found a small cage and leftover ferret food in a dumpster near where we found him.  I put two and two together and realized that someone had actually thrown him away.  Such cruelty and careless attitude!  I decided right then that even if we found the \"true\" owner, I wasn't returning him.  Upon further investigation, we found that a person had been recently evicted, and had not only thrown the ferret in the garbage, but had also abandoned their dog in their now vacant apartment.  I now had to make a choice - do I want to keep and raise this adorable little weasel, or hand him over to animal control to be adopted out.  The decision was quite easy for me.  Although I knew nothing about ferrets, he was so cute and loving (as well as a little terrorist to my dog), I would research everything I knew so that this little guy would have the best life possible.  While caring for him has added a lot of additional responsibility, time and financial investment, he's just about the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.

Of course, that's years ago now at this point. I found out that he had a few dark years after high school, he told me the trouble he got into. He spent a few years in jail for burglary, but said those days are long behind him. We are both old now. We kind of realized simultaneously at the restaurant how two punk kids whose parents and teachers told them they were going to be nothing ended up having pretty nice lives. Also, it didn't matter anyway all the people who had their sour opinions about us are dead at this point anyway. We talked for a few more hours, before we realized that it had been a few hours.

Around three months or so ago I talked with my supervisor about possibly advancing through the ranks.

Anyway, he was totally on board with that and hinted at an opening in management that would make me a team supervisor, but it wasn't really up to him (it's the coordinator's job to pick and choose promotions). So I shrugged and tried to win the part. I came in early every day, helped answer questions from the new people in the office, and even took on that extra project from the finance department. Of course, three months later that opening gets taken by some new hire. I was feeling pretty dejected but apparently the coordinator took notice of my efforts and actually gave me a small raise. That was a nice incentive, and plus I can add some finance related stuff and other employable skills to my resume. I guess all in all I'm not even sure if I would have liked the management position anyways, and it's got me wondering if maybe I should take what experience I have from this position and move on. The pay is good, about decent for a data scientist, but I'd really enjoy taking on some more long term projects or having a leadership position. Working here was invaluable as someone new to the industry and trying to learn the ropes, but if there's no hope of working my way through the ranks, then it's probably best if I part ways. I'm a little stung about the promotion, but honestly I'm not upset about it anymore. The raise was at least something, and I'm thinking with the experience I got from the finance project that I can look into a job at a bank corporation that reached out to me. It would be a smaller office and more tight knit environment, which I think I'd prefer more.

My father and uncle stood at the gate to receive the guests. The marriage party arrived at-seven in the evening. First, the guests were served sweets and cold drinks. Many guests had brought different gifts for my cousin who was the bride. The marriage party members were very gentle. The groom was seated on a palanquin with thick garlands around his neck. The marriage ceremony was held after the reception. Many senior members including my parents and the parents of the groom were present at the time of the holy marriage on the shrine. The bride and the groom exchanged garlands and sacredly accepted each other as the partner of life. We cried when my cousin parted with us and went to her new house."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

That being said I am now walking 5 miles 4-5 times a week, am actively hunting for a job, my cleanliness and grooming are also hugely improved to daily cleaning and showering(I would straighten the house maybe 3 times a year and was living in squalor and was only bathing a couple times a  month), and there have been other improvements in my overall outlook and quality of life as well these are just some major ones.  There have been a few negatives, mostly just being a bit more forgetful, but nothing compared to the side effects that left me sleeping most of the day and tired the rest.

We were in a moving truck, but this one was a rental that none of us had ever used. We arrived about 45 minutes later, through the traffic and construction, to downtown Dallas, and all three of the truck docks were taken, nothing new there. If we didn't arrive half an hour before our load-in time, it was bound to happen, so I convinced a security guard to let us use a side-dock on a street they normally didn't use. The dock was adjacent to a street that was on an incline, and we had about 5 hours to unload everything, move it into place, clean it, and get out before people started pouring in. A few hours passed, so far so good. Then we got to the walls. Our company makes these pre-fab walls that we set-up, drill together and weigh-down with sandbags, and I had installed these a thousand times. My co-worker and I started rolling the cart loaded with about 1,500 lbs of walls to the liftgate, and we accounted for the slope, very cautious as usual. I was between the cart of walls and the street as my co-worker started to lower the liftgate, and as the liftgate reached the ground and I was about to roll the cart off, I felt the cart start to tip. The next thing I knew, everything was on top of me and I felt a sudden flash of pain and adrenaline. I thought I was dead. In what seemed like just a second, the cart tipped over on me, knocked me back, and was lifted off by two of my co-workers. The liftgate on the rental truck we decided to use for the evening had and extra little incline on the end, and paired with incline of the hill we decided to unload on, the extra little five inches of ramp sent the cart over the tipping point. I couldn't move my foot. I looked down and saw it laying unnaturally flat against the pavement and I later found out that the cart had dislocated my foot from my leg and broken two bones. It seemed like forever before the ambulance arrived. All I could think about was my girlfirend since we had a baby on the way and I was the only one working. How would we pay the bills?

He started by just bringing me some freshly made (by him) soup on a cold day. I didn't ask. He just brought it over, knocked on the door, and said eat this. It meant the world to me. No one else has ever done something like that for me, especially without asking for anything in return. I hadn't been eating, too, so that was something that started me on the path to recovery. After that, he began inviting me over more to play video games and relax, or go out for physical activities like walks and runs, which helped me get more Vitamin D in my system and just to get some more endorphins via activity. Also more socializing by hanging out and getting out of the house. He never once judged me for it, and never once asked for anything in return. And now that I'm fully back to health, and lost the weight, and feeling like a million bucks, I still stay in that same level of contact with him, knowing that one day it may be my turn to return the favor. And I want to be there if and when that does happen, because I've learned about the value of true friendship."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

However, we did not just move we bought our first house. We didn't move very far from the townhome that we were renting but the process of buying a house and moving when you have kids is all very challenging for sure. I am 47 years old and I catch myself thinking that I will be able to do these things the way I could before but then I realize that before all this I wasn't married, had no kids and was younger and had more energy! It's been about 3 months now and the worst of it is over and I feel relaxed and pretty settled in. There's always some fun things to for example, I thought it was fun to have my first Ring doorbell set up, and of course not having to deal with landlords anymore and their just greed and total lack of understanding that we needed things like heat and a working stove. Right now sitting at home and working I think if I was still living in that place and trying to get through this day there would be this huge cloud of stress over me from that situation. I also have a better layout now though where I don't have to go up and down stairs all the time like you have to do in a townhome. And we're a single family home! No more shared walls! There's so many good things now and I'm so happy and thankful that we were able to do this. One of the best things to come out of this was pretty surprising - instead of just leaving wall mounts the previous owners left behind 2 smart tvs! They actually also left behind a pool table but during the property negotiations we were pretty sure that they would be leaving that. They may not have expected to leave or give so many things but I think that they had so many property transactions going on and so much of their own moving stress that they just had to do whatever to be done with it all and move with kids and dogs and all the things that must have made their own move very difficult. I think they were actually a week or two between closings as well the way that their timing worked out and they had to store everything and just live in a hotel for awhile. It's much easier to go from renting to buying a house then to go from one property that you own to another I think. I'm glad things worked out the way they did for us and I think everything worked out for the sellers as well. They were definitely a blessing to us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

When we got the hospital things became a little bit complicated. Her husband tried his best to be with her and to keep her strong. She eventually delivered perfectly. After deliver, she had to stay at the hospital for a while. Back at her home, I had been planning a surprise return for her. It was expected that the surprise return party would make her feel happy. Finally, she was discharged from the hospital. When she got home, and saw the surprise return party she just burst into tears. According to her a tsunami of emotions engulfed her at that moment. Her husband couldn't help but started crying as well. It was beautiful to watch and really emotional."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

I remember the first time I went diving as a child.  It was one of the best days.  My dad took me out diving and it was so incredible.   We had so many great Saturday afternoons spent on the water.  As I grew older and started to go to different places I met other dive masters.  I did't realize that people could get paid to go diving.  It was pretty cool to think that maybe I could do that for a job.  I put off getting my certifications because it's expensive.  It's also kind of scary to think that I will be responsible for other's peoples lives.  But the truth is that anytime you are diving you are responsible to help out the people that are around you.  I really think that now is the right time in my life to pursue this.  I've looked around at some different schools and I've picked the one that is going to be right for me.

Well I got the results back, and there was actually a cousin I never knew I had who lived just a mile away in our little senior community! From what I understand, she's a cousin on my father's side, the daughter of his sister. I guess there was some bad blood between her and her parents when she was young, and so she ran away. I'm not sure if my crazy aunt (she really is a piece of work) ever tried to look for her or filed a missing person's report or anything, but this missing cousin ended up right near me after all these years! It took me a few days, Diary, to get up the courage to try to contact her. Finally, I looked her up on the internet and found a number for her. I dialed, said who I was and what the DNA test had revealed, and, surprisingly, she was so thrilled to hear from me! We made a date for coffee at the little shop that's part of our community. When I walked in, I could spot her right away. I could see the family resemblance right away! We must have talked for three hours! Turns out after she left, she got in with a bad crowd, but turned her life around after she got pregnant. She raised her kid the best she could (he turned out great and such a handsome young man!) and worked her way up to head buyer for her company. What's even more amazing is that she's a horror movie fan, just like me! I'm looking forward to hanging out with her more, and to meeting her son as well. Gotta go, Diary.

I had mentioned cooking bbq to send with her this year. I love bbq. Throughout the year I will have a few big cookouts, have people over to eat and have drinks and will generally share with neighbors as well. So the day before she left, I woke up at 4am and fired up our big offset cooker (the smoker) and prepped roughly 30 lbs of meat. I threw the meat on and tended to the fire all day all while she ran around took care of any last minute errands she needed to take care of before leaving. The meat hit its plateau, one of the longest I had experienced in my roughly 20 years of cooking bbq. Stressed because even when these were finished we still had work to do. At around 10pm they finished, we pulled them and let them rest. We then quickly shredded, and vacuum sealed all the meat for her trip. She leaves on her trip. We talk occasionally but no mention of the bbq. Day 2 passes, still haven't heard anything about the barbecue I sent. I just assumed it would be a few people and a maybe a small dinner get together and they would probably enjoy it. On day three I received some pictures of some tables and a tent setup with my bbq on display. They had invited everybody. At this point I am concerned. Is this type of bbq everyone's cup of tea? Apparently so, as I received a picture of groups of people eating and having a good time. My wife called and said it was a huge success, some even had as many three to four pulled pork sandwiches, she explained that people who didn't even plan on coming showed up to eat after they heard about the bbq. It was a hit and they all thanked me. It felt good to know it was a success. My hard work paid off."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

It's a convention we go to every year but this year a new friend decided to come with us and we were able to introduce him to the experience we have every year. It's a convention with music and lots of arcade games, we always end up staying up all night playing games and sleeping during the day when the arcade space is super busy. It's an all night convention so you get the most out of the arcade if you stay up all night and play games while most of the other people are back at their own hotels or are asleep. During the day and especially on the weekends it gets way too crowded in the arcade space to really enjoy it without waiting in super long lines. So it makes more sense to just become a night owl for the duration of the trip and enjoy yourself at night. We managed to get a room with a balcony in the hotel of the convention itself which is the goal every year we go. It costs a bit more but being able to sit on the balcony and wind down while still watching the convention is always worth the extra cost. Our friend seemed to enjoy himself and managed to get some autographs from a composer he really likes so hopefully he joins the yearly crew that goes. Every year I tend to focus on some different things and get some new things out of it. This time I was even more arcade focused than usual because I was really into a specific cabinet I can only find at this place every year. The other part of the trip I always look forward to is the food. There is a really good Chinese food place just a quick walk from the hotel we go to every year. There is also a steak place we go to at least once if not twice every year we go. Aside from those two though we tend to just stock up on snacks and maybe order some Grubhub or UberEats to pick up at the hotel. As lots of the convention area is overbooked with people trying to get food. We had some trouble with our room keys not working properly but other than that the trip was flawless and was a much needed vacation. I am looking forward to going again next year and I hope the same group continues to go as it's one of the things I look forward to most every year.

My aunt was trying her best to keep her head above water and grieve in her own time and way but she completely let grief take her over. I had been witnessing a steady decline in her mental health the past few years and her behavior getting more erratic and manic and suspected that she was self-medicating.

Luckily my brother smelled the gas and remedied the situation. So that incident told me that she was not doing well at all. Then a couple of months later in the spring she had a complete mental break. Which in a way was what she needed I think, as much as it pained me to see her like this. I think she finally needed to break and hit rock bottom and scare herself to realize how much she had not been dealing with her grief. We had long talks about this, she and I, and she admits that she had not actually been dealing with her grief even though she thought she was and doing it to the best of her ability. We started sharing our travels of grief and I confided in her that I had gone to grief therapy, which she knew was a huge step for me because I have been against myself (only myself) going to therapy since I was made to go to family counseling against my will when I was younger. I told her how angry I had become after losing both my grandmother and my cousin and that anger was how grief had manifested in me. I also told her that it was OK to let grief in even though it is so painful. The more you push it down the worse it will be to overcome later.

One code lead to another, to another, to another and after about a week 99% of my job was automated, which gave me more time. With this time I started really looking at the stuff I had been tasked with sorting and noticed that it was wrong. The data points didn't match up and it didn't fit with what common sense said the final results should be. So I started looking deeper, and found not one or two but about 10 different flaws from the previous people who did this work. So I started fixing it, and after about a week it was done, the data was clean and things started matching up. So I took it to my boss, let him know what I found, where the problem was, and what I had done to fix it. He was first confused at how I had the time to do it, which is when I let him know I wrote the codes to do the grunt work for me. Then he asked me to do the same thing for a different set of reports. I came back a couple of hours late with the results. More errors, and how to fix them. Right there, on the spot he promoted me to Workforce Data Analyst. I was shocked, less than four weeks in and I was in a team lead level roll just because I found some problems."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

I got to see so much and do so many things I hadn't before. I even tried rock climbing and skydiving. It was an amazing experience. After a few weeks of this though I got a little tired of just living out of my truck. I missed the comfort of a bed and TV so I rented a motel room. That was a big mistake. I didn't think about how much that would cut into my funds. After only a few days in the motel room I had run out of money. I was determined though. I did NOT want to go back to my boring 9 to 5 job and monotonous lifestyle. I kept trying to live this lifestyle because it felt so good to me. While continuing my adventure I found a parking lot that I could stay in because it was never really full. Having no money made it hard though, I really couldnt keep up the adventurous lifestyle of pleasure I was seeking the way I wanted to anymore But I wasn't going to give up. That is until the worst case scenario happened. A few days after moving into that parking lot I heard a knock on my window. Two police officers were outside and they looked mad. They asked me what I was doing and I confidently explained that I left home to pursue a life of personal pleasure and to get away from it all. They weren't hearing it though and a couple minutes later I was asked to step out of the car where they cuffed me and took me to jail.

We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. This vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. There were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. Every morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. That evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. After everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying. Nope, FOOD POISONING!!! I was up for several hours becoming best friends with the porcelain god. While it was not funny at the time because I was literally thinking that I was dying, I look back now and laugh because everyone talks about me getting food poisoning and the shape that I was in.

It felt as if a part of him was still here, as if he reached out to me across some invisible distance. His daughter looks so much like him, especially her eyes. I began to wonder whether I would be able to refrain from being overly emotional if we actually met in real life because looking at her would remain me so much of my husband. I miss him dearly and I hope that this new relationship and connection with his daughter will bring me comfort and peace in knowing that some part of him still lives through her. Perhaps her reaching out to me was meant to be, a little gift of love that my husband sent from heaven to ease the pain of his loss. I'm happy that she will have the opportunity to meet our son, her half brother. They are not too far apart in age and both go to college, so maybe they will have some things in common. They also have similar faces since they both look so much like their father.  My husband kept a lot of things for the kids. He was a gifted writer and filled many notebooks with poems and short stories to pass along to his children. I definitely want them to see his writing and see how talented their dad was. Maybe even pass it along to their kids. I also have other mementos like photos and records that I know he would want them to have. One step at a time, however.

The church promotes well being through their lord of opportunity which only the worthy are saved. In order to prove worthiness you are to let your body deteriorate. You only eat when you are allotted food, which is about twice a week in meager portions. Bathing, cleaning, grooming are all strictly prohibited. Any contact with family or attempts to break free are temptations that the lord does not look kindly on. Jane went over to lucys house and said she had lost significant weight, looked unkempt, and the house was a mess. She was informed by garret that Lucy couldnt speak to family on grounds of initiation. She called the police bu they informed her that they cannot do anything as she is doing this of her own free will. I never knew such cults existed and don't know what to do now. Lucy was always so normal and has become something else because of garret. I can only hope that she will come to her senses and take care of herself.

He was hit by a drunk driver whose four wheel drive pickup smashed into the driver's side of my brother's small, Toyota Yaris, killing my brother instantly. My brother was only 20 years old, still studying at college and had only begun to live his life. My youngest brother was the baby of the family being the youngest of 5. He was the only brother so was especially cherished by his 4 older sisters. He was studious, giving, caring and tried to do the right thing at all times. He volunteered at the homeless shelter in his college town. He attended mass every week. He took time to keep in touch with out parents and with all of our sisters. My family is devastated. This is our first loss in our family and none of us are quite sure how to deal with the hurt. We are close, all live in the same town and have each other but that doesn't seem to assuage any of the hurt or loss in our hearts. My mother has turned to the church, talking to our priest, praying and attending functions. My father has turned inward, trying to heal himself. My sisters and I have tried to help our parents but as we are suffering as well it has been a botched job at best. My sisters and I can help each other though, lending a sympathetic ear at least. We are still muddling through this and I don't know that my family will ever completely get over the loss of our baby brother. My little brother was an avid outdoors person who loved to hike, canoe and camp. Because of this my sisters and I are thinking of creating a sort of memorial along one of his favorite hiking trails in our town. The trail has a program where you can plant a tree and/or pay for a bench along the trail which helps fund the trail. I want to do both, plant a tree which will shade the bench as it grows, with a plaque showing it was donated in my brother's name. I think this would be a wonderful way to memorialize my little brother as he loved being outside hiking while always having his old Pentax film camera along with him. As I write this I find I have made the decision, I will do this for sure, plant a tree for my brother and provide a place for weary hikers to sit in memorial to him."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

The people at the shelter took him and his sister out of the cage and put us in a room with the two so we can interact with them. The female kitten was partially rambunctious, while the male one was more meek. My parents then stated they wanted the male one but were not going to take the female Kitten for she was too energetic.

I lamented the fact that I would likely never see him again, because I had just won a full-ride scholarship to Stanford University and would be in California for the next four years of my life. When Rachel found out about my scholarship, she spread a fake rumor around our high school that I had cheated my way into Stanford. I could not believe her audacity at snubbing me. I will keep holding a grudge against her. I look forward to the day that I can sabotage her career. I told my best friend Paulina the good news about my scholarship, but instead of being happy for me, she started crying. I reckon this is because she also applied for the scholarship but got rejected instead. We haven't talked since then, and I am conflicted between whether I should end our friendship or reach out to her first and make up. If we were to make up, the first thing I would do is bake her some cupcakes, because that is her favorite type of dessert. I would have to bake the cupcakes by myself, because I have no significant other to bake them with. Now that Richard is leaving forever, I  need to find a new secret crush so I do not have to do so many things by myself. What do you think, diary?

So last winter we set our sights on fixing anything that needed fixing in order to put our home up for sale. This included painting the walls, a new roof, and new siding in some areas. At the end of winter, our house was ready for the real estate market. We were all very anxious about putting the house on the market. My parents began looking for a new place to live and my siblings and I were trying to imagine a world in which we did not come home to the house we had grown up in and made so many memories in. After a couple of months on the market and a price drop, the home finally had an offer at the beginning of summer. But that is also where the headache began for myself and my parents. The people who put in the offer made too many demands including leaving some furniture and appliance items that we had planned to take with. After we conceded to some of what they wanted, the process of them getting verified to actually by the house turned in to a long drawn out process. In fact, mid way through summer my parents were just ready to be done with it as they had envisioned it going much smoother. My parents had to resign documents many times and were continuously told that the final offer might not go through, so they were stuck between purchasing their new home or waiting. Finally, at the tail end of summer, just as I was heading off to college, the offer went through and my parents were given 30 days to leave the home. By that point, I was already preparing to leave for college so it didn't seem to take as much of a toll on me as I thought it would. My parents were so fed up with how the process went, that they too were ready to say goodbye.

I first became a Christian when I was eleven years old. It was honestly a traumatic experience for me because I was raised in churches that were, to be bluntly and brutally honest, cruel to my family and me. My parents were ostracized for many, many things, including the fact that my dad had an old navy tattoo and my mom homeschooled us. Were were basically the poster children for teasing and humiliation. As I grew older, my perception of God grew more and more confused. In fact, I developed a true and utter terror of God and Jesus. Churches pounded hell, fire, and brimstone, so I just turned myself over to serve God out of terror. When I became a Christian, I broke because I felt that I was still sinning or forgetting to read my Bible sometimes, or losing my temper. I felt that I needed to be rebaptized since I didn't read my Bible all the time due to forgetting, or the fact that I was going through puberty and would sometimes lash out at my family. I now know that I have PCOS and PMDD, so that explains a lot, but my old self thought I was clearly unregenerate and worthy of hell even in my saved state. I would pray the \"sinner's prayer\" every night out of fear that I wasn't living perfectly enough and, should I die, I would burn in hell. I eventually felt that I lost my faith. After losing my grandmother, my faith in God dwindled away, piece by piece, because I was angry that an all-powerful God could let this horrible thing--this death-- continue when He had the power to stop it. I was going to a very modern church, and I felt even more disconnected because the church never spoke of much of anything except \"self help.\" I felt like I had to leave there, but I was afraid. So I began tearing up the Bible and deep theology, determined to understand God in ways that I never had before. I read words of wisdom from the Bible and great Biblical scholars like Swindoll, McGarthur, J.C. Ryle...I couldn't sleep at night, because, as I was digging deeper, I realized that I never truly understood the Bible until then. Never. I would sleep little, spending late, late hours of the night in study and prayer. It was life-changing because, out of this \"metamorphosis,\" I began to truly connect to God and understand our purpose on this earth. I understood the plan--why Jesus had to die, why His timing for ending the world is perfect, and why we shouldn't fear death if we put our faith in Him. It all began to make sense -- the meaning of baptism, the reason we struggle with sin...God is our advocate to walk with us through it all. We don't have to be perfect -- we strive, we pray, and we constantly crave a deeper connection to our God. It changed me, and I am walking the path to re-baptism because I truly love God and His plan for our lives."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

I was out of town at the time of the first storm but came back to wet carpets and a damp smell. I couldnt figure out where the leak was coming from right away, but as the next storm came I started to hear dripping. I trace the dripping to the window where my AC unit plugged in. Sure enough the seal on the window was not very tight and the groove filled with water. This combined with the slightly downward angle of the unit caused a leak to happen. I took the unit out of the window and shut the window for the duration of the storm. Once the window unit was out I noticed that it was pretty dirty and had a bit of debris on the bottom helping the water to pool underneath. I removed the debris and wiped off the unit with a towel. I also placed a shim in place to get the angle more closer to 0 degrees to prevent leaking. I went upstairs to check the other units and they seemed fine. However once I turned on the upstairs one it started sputtering a bit of water. I took this one out of the window as well and turned it upside down onto a towel. There was a bit of loose droplets in there but i got most of them. As a precaution i placed a towel over it when i turned it back on to flick the remaining water into. After this event I will be sure to check the units every year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

She was very protective of our family, but not mean at all. So, today has been one of the worst days of my life. We agreed that she was suffering and no way to get better and we were just being selfish, so we decided today would be it. We called our Vet who had been expecting this call. He told us to come on and with a heavy leaden heart, we got her into the car. She liked car rides and didn't mind the vet as she'd known the same one all her life. We both got out of the car with tears in our eyes and let her pee on the grass and then took her inside. They were ready for us and  we put her on the table and got her calm and said our good-byes. It was almost like she looked at me with understanding and was okay about it. We stayed with her and the Vet injected her with the drug.

I spotted one guy sitting there with just a small blanket, though he wasn't using the blanket, the blanket was curled around a small dog, who looked as though he had seen better days. I dug into my pockets and checked what I had for cash, and it wasn't much. I stopped to talk to him, and learned he had been laid off 2 years ago and lost his home and has no family near by. I talked to him for a bit learning that he found the dog abandoned one day and decided to keep him. His money that he gets from panhandling goes to feeding his dog, who is his best friend. I asked him if he was hungry and he looked at me quite surprised and said he was starving, he was lucky to eat at all each day. He asked a friend of his a few feet away to watch his dog, and off we went to get some lunch.

According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax.

Your the one who constantly used me, abused me, and shouted at me when i did anything you didn't like. I guess i have regret and that's what bothering me today. The regret that i should of divorced this person a long time ago.  It feels he got the last laugh in this whole mess. I also felt i needed to write about it so it doesn't build up inside of me.

He had been really stressed out at his job, was feeling burned out from it, and was having trouble sleeping. He knew that I have a background in psychology, as well general health and well being, so I might be able to help him out. We first talked about what he thought might have been triggering the stress and anxiety at work. He said that he was having trouble concentrating because he was always feeling fatigued at work. This fatigue was starting to impact his job performance because he was struggling to get all his tasks done during the work day. The next thing I asked him was how well he was sleeping at night, and he said that he was having a lot of trouble falling asleep. In fact, he would toss and turn for a while, and then he would get on his phone for a little while, hoping that this would make him sleepy. I explained to him that maintaining proper sleep health is really important in having high quality sleep. People should only ever do two things in bed: sleep or have sex. The reason for this, is when you do other activities in bed, you are confusing your brain on whether or not you should be sleeping. Because of this, when you lay down in bed, you should never be reading or on your phone because this can compromise healthy sleep. After that, we talked about nutrition. Eric tends to eat oatmeal for breakfast on most days, a sandwich and vegetables or fruit for lunch, and he usually orders takeout for dinner. This did not seem like a big deal to me, but when I pressed him about what he typically drinks on a daily basis, he says that he pretty much just drinks sodas or coffee all day, and only stops the caffeinated drinks half an hour before bed. I explained to him that this is a really unhealthy habit. Not only are you putting yourself at risk for diabetes and hypertension from that level of caffeine and sugar, but you are also making it very difficult for yourself to fall asleep when you drink them almost all the way up until you go to bed. My recommendation for him was to significantly cut out the caffeine from his diet (as well as drink more water), and try to maintain healthier sleep habits. These things have worked for me in the past, so I am sure that they would work for him."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

We have recently started to spend time together again. My birthday was in June. Traditionally, I would spend my birthday with my mother. We would go to a movie, and then out to eat, and we would end the day with birthday cake. Since my mother died two years ago, my birthday has been very sad. But this year, I invited her sister and brother to share the day with me. We went to see The Secret Life of Pets 2, which we all enjoyed. We had a nice lunch out together. And then we came back to my house for birthday cake. They really made the day special and memorable for me. If I couldn't spend it with my mom, at least I could spend it with people who loved her as much as I did. We had such a good time that day that we decided to re-start some old family traditions that I remember from my childhood. Since then we have also celebrated my uncle's birthday and had a great time that day too. We are making plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am happy that my birthday celebration was the beginning of healing old rifts in my family."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

I asked him out and I really felt bad because really I didn't like him at all just his style of clothing. He really liked me and he was even falling in love with me so I never told him I didn't truly like him. We started dating for a long time but behind his back I was seeing other men and I still felt terrible but never told him. He was into me so much he asked my dad if he could marry me wants we graduated. My dad didn't know I didn't really like him so my dad told him of course because he was a hard working great guy. I really needed to tell him that we could be friends but he wasn't the guy for me. I decided to tell him the next time we went out together just me and him I didn't want to embarrass him. One day we got in the car together and went to the movies we both love the movies I didn't know it was the day he planed on proposing to me. I told him that we needed to talk and he said that he needed to talk to and he had something special for me. So I asked him if I could go first and he said that would be great he was always sweet. So I told him that i loved him and he was a great guy but that I thought we could only be friends. He was so sweet he said he loved me to and he was wanting to marry me but he totally understand and thought that would be great that would could be friends and never loss touch. Months went by and I found out that he was going to marry me the same day I appalled to him and he was alright he actually found someone else.
