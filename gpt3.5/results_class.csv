0,"In early June I accompanied my friends to a music festival. It was in Orlando and it was my first time going to something like this. I wasn't going to go initially but I ended up getting the weekend off so I figured I had nothing to lose. We went up to Orlando the day before in order to get settled in and hang with some friends before the festival. The next day we went out and got all the essentials we would need for the day, namely alcohol. We had a few drinks in the hotel room and then took an Uber to the location of the festival. It was a pool party and everyone was dressed accordingly. I normally don't dance too much but after a few shots of vodka and a few beers I was a dancing machine. The weather was a bit gray and overcast but it was actually a blessing. Hundreds of people dancing and sweating wouldn't smell very good. We ended up dancing and partying until it started raining. When the rain came we decided we had enough and took an Uber to get something to eat. My age had caught up to me by that time and I realized how tired I was. I could barely hold my head up at the table but I was able to get through my meal. We then headed back to the room and slept like babies. All in all I had a really good time and I wouldn't mind going again.",True,True,True,B,True
1,"I was at work when I received a flurry of texts from my family and friends. My mother rarely texts me, so I knew something was up. My birthday was next weekend and I had planned with my partner to have a quiet day. But this morning he was acting strangely. He acted like he had some kind of secret that he was dying to tell me but and was struggling to restrain himself. He's never been good at keeping a secret. After receiving so many out of the ordinary texts, I suspected maybe I was in for a surprise party. While I do love a good surprise, I don't want to look a mess. I can look quite the fright after a day at work. My mother, who is in many ways my twin, realizes this, which is probably why she texted me. She didn't reveal anything specific but by simply texting me, I knew something was up. I decided to cut out of work a bit early and hit Nordstrom's before I went home. If there really were a bunch of people at my house waiting to yell ""Surprise!"" at me, I wanted to look good. I found a cute dress which I wore out of the store. I reapplied my makeup while in the parking lot. When I opened the door to my house at least 30 people jumped out at me. Balloons were releases and party horns were blown. My mother came up and gave me a hug. ""New dress huh?"" she asked smiling at me. ""Yep"" I replied, ""thanks for the heads up."" She smiled knowingly at me and handed me a glass of champagne. I love surprises but I also like to be prepared for them.",False,False,False,B,True
2,"A week ago my husband and I went away for his birthday. It was a blast! The hotel we stayed in was really modern and great, it had a lot of art around the grounds that we went and looked at. Most specifically there was a guitar that used to be owned by Roy Orbison that my husband was super excited about. We spent some time watching his favorite movie in this really crazy state of the art theater. The movie we watched was an Anime film that I didn't like, but wow was it great in that theater! We had a really nice time swimming and really enjoyed it, it was great exercise. The restaurant was fantastic and served us great steak. It was wild because normally he only likes the steak I make for him, but this time he really enjoyed it. It made me feel self conscious and that I had to do better the next time I make steak. The most memorable thing we did was drink a little too much and get into the whirlpool tub. At first it felt really great but after a little while we began to feel woozy. When we got out, we felt very dizzy and sick to our stomachs. We had to go lay down. Neither of us felt that we'd drank that much, but I guess we were wrong! Next time we will be careful not to do such a thing.",False,False,False,B,True
3,This has been some year for me. When I was a teenager I dreamed of my own family one day. The same dream I've had most of my life. But now that dream has died. I have never been someone woman desire or like. I thought I could overcome that obstacle and have my dream family one day. But it all came crashing down this year. I waited to long and gave to little effort to my dream. Now my health is slowly worsening and no one wants to be with me. It hurts so much when I think of all the years wasted instead of following my dream. When I look at the rest of my life.

6,"Ever since I've lived on my own, I've been a little wild.  Experimenting with drugs was probably the first of it, and it never really stopped.  I wouldn't say I've ever had a ""problem,"" but it has made me view the world, and the people surrounding me differently, less judgmentally - maybe sometimes more judgmentally.  Recently, I was invited to a ""dance party under the stars,"" where I went to a swimming hole to camp in a town that no longer has a police force.  I did what I always do in these situations - I took psychedelic drugs and went on an adventure in my mind. But this time it was different - this time, no one else was doing the same.  For the first time, this ""hobby"" of mine I used to make friends and relate to people, made me an outcast.  I was alone, I was terrified - I was hiding in my car ripping my inner self to shreds and rebuilding who I was.  For eight hours, I hated who I was, what I was doing, and I just wanted to disappear, I wanted everyone to forget I existed - while simultaneously knowing how much it would hurt when I was forgotten.  I spent that night alone. While everyone else was dancing under the stars, drinking, and sharing love, I was hiding so no one would know what I had done.  In retrospect, I do not think I would have been as harshly judged as I felt like I was in that moment, but I do believe no one would have wanted to spend that evening with me anyways.  I missed out on a good time because I tried to make it better with substances. We are a sum of our experiences, we must take the good with the bad.

9,"About three months ago I had the opportunity to visit an animal shelter to look at some dogs. I had been really bummed since my dog of 15 years past away due to old age. I had been very depressed about my dog's passing and I thought it may be a good idea to adopt a new puppy. My family, especially my youngest son has been wanting another dog. Although it would be tough for me to take on the ""emotional"" responsibility of  having another pet, I feel that my son deserves to have a loyal pet, the same chance I had. Plus having a new puppy around is always super interesting, challenging, and FUN. This will allow me the chance to delegate and teach responsibility to my son. He is 11 now and I feel its time for him to take up some chores. This will also allow him to grow closer to the dog.. as I did with my previous pet. Seeing the new puppy brought joy to my family and my son was ecstatic. Truth be told I really got a little sad and I thought about Nova, my previous dog. Nova was great dog and we were really close. The new Puppy will soon take over as the family pet, but I will never forget Nova. She definitely made my life more interesting and enjoyable.

It is so hard growing up today. There are so many confusing messages coming from so many different places. It is a scary world, and the one place a kid should feel safe and accepted is at home. I hope my daughter always feels that way. She said her biggest fear was that we would treat her differently now. I told her we might have to muddle through some awkward questions and conversations together, but that I will be here to support her health and happiness.

12,"Five months ago, I went through one of the worst periods in my life. I suffer from clinical depression. It is difficult to put into words how deep and dark that place can be. Everything that I typically enjoy doing faded away. Food tasted less delicious. My interest in sports faded. It seemed as though the light had gone out of my world. The people I am closest to became less important to me. I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. I would either sleep too little or too much. I couldn't find any semblance of peace or enjoyment in my life. I talked to my doctor and he increased the dosage of my medication. It took almost 3 months to pull out of that deep depression. To people that have not experienced depression, it is absolutely crippling. Mental health is a topic that is not well understood. People think you are ""just down"" or ""blue"" but it goes much deeper than that. By the beginning of August, I started to feel like myself again. Light had entered my life once again. The experience made me so thankful to be out of that dark place. I have experienced 4 other similar episodes in my life. The most recent depression was the worst of the 5.

16,"Wow what a fantastic day! This morning we woke up to such a gorgeous sunny day. The family decided to take a day to go and enjoy the beach together. I was really excited as it was to just go swimming and enjoy the sun and sand but the coolest thing happened when we got there. We saw a stand advertising discounted surfboard rentals and everyone decided to give surfing a go. At first no one could figure it out so we were mostly just laughing and falling all over the place. Eventually though some of us figured it out and we enjoyed playing and riding around on the waves. I even managed to catch one really good wave and stay up riding through the whole thing! I was pretty proud and excited about that. Still the coolest part of the day hadn't even happened yet. At one point near dinnertime, as we were talking about heading in for the day, my brother noticed something shiny in the water. We all turned to look just in time to see a dolphin pop out of the water! It was unbelievably cool to see up close. A couple other dolphins joined him, there was even a baby!

While he was torn about the whole thing, it made me think about the times I spent with her. She took good care of me even though I wasn't technically family and we had a lot of good times together. That was a long time ago, though, and that probably made it easier for me to settle with the fact that I could not even make time to attend her funeral. I was surprised by how he handled my rejection well enough, but also how I was even able to accept it afterwards. I guess I'm realizing a part of myself that lacks the empathy that I wish I had. So, running through events quickly in my head, I probably was thinking about the significance or connection I had to the event but instead should have been thinking about how my friend would feel about my attendance. I think this event gave me a good perspective on what I am and what I think I should become. I need to be able to hold the people that I care for, and the people that care for me, closer than I do.

These words made me sick to my stomach as my brother called me. He had never been a part of my life, but I was always fond of the memories I had with him when I was a child up to the age of seven, when the divorce happened. This man who I missed, but barely knew. And now he wasn't long for the world. I made it to the hospice they kept him at. Coming into the room, I stared at the frail figure reclining on the bed before me.

27,"April 30, 2019Today was a very memorable day.  It started at 7:50 AM when my group members and I gave a presentation in our stats class.  The presentation seemed to go fairly well and I am not too worried about my grade as I do not need a high one to maintain my A.  Afterwards, I went to the health science building and began studying for my anatomy practical/exam.  My grade this was VERY important.  I had to make at least an 88 to maintain my A in the class.  I had began studying HARD two weeks prior and had spent nearly 20 hours over the weekend digging through cadavers trying to make sense of it all.  Now, I only had 5 more hours to prepare, so I made the most of my time by focusing hard on the fringe topics that I currently knew the least about.  As studied, time accelerated until I got to the point where I needed to go change into my scrubs.  I showed up outside of the lab, behind a line of about twelve of the fifteen other students.  This meant that I would likely not go into the practical until the second round (we only had about nine stations and fifteen won't fit).  This was a bittersweet realization, as I both wanted to get it done and also wanted to study a bit more.  This indeed came to pass, as I waited another 30 minutes after arriving before the practical began.  During this, I spoke with one of classmates quite a bit about her dog, as I shuffled back and forth over my notes. Once the practical began, things seemed to go very well until about the eighth question.  Suddenly, the professors had rearranged a cadaver's cranium and disarticulated the mandible to provide a different vantage point of many structures than we had seen during the dissection itself.  I did my best and moved on, but not before several more hiccups were thrown my way.  After the practical, we moved on to the written exam portion.  This was the hardest one to date and I had to attempt to make sense of bits of information I had in my head as the seam together into a coherent biological system.  Nothing felt as good as I wanted it to.  I was afraid that I was going to lose my A.  After wrapping up my exam, I slowly walked up to turn it in, got my things, and left.

It was only a month ago that my surgery took place to remove testicular cancer. This feeling of dread from the scan to see if the cancer had spread has been a awful time. My high fear and stress took over, leaving me worried about the smallest thing. Though my doctors have been a help, I was so nervous to weight for the result.

She wanted to talk to me to see if I might be interested in the position. After we met, I asked her what she wanted the next steps to be. She got very vague, and talked about how they needed to let the other girl leave, and really take a look at their work load and see figure out what they needed in this new person. I thought that would be the end of it, I thought she didn't know what she wanted to do, and didn't know if I was a part of that at all. Then she circled back with me in about a week, and said we should talk more about her company. I went over to her house after work one day, and we sat on the front porch and chatted. She explained they needed someone who could start out doing operations and learning the business, then in 6 months they could add in marketing and a bump in title and pay. Eventually, she wants this person to be the COO so she can retire. Then she said she could bring me in at my current salary, and would I be interested?

43,"This past June was a momentous time in my life for a couple of reasons.  Towards the beginning of the month I turned 26 years old and a week or so after that I graduated from UC San Diego with an engineering degree.  It marked the beginning of my true independence and adulthood, though I may have been considered an adult before.  Upon graduating I began to realize the responsibility and pressures that life was staring to lay upon me.   Before I graduated life was very simple and my only responsibilities were to complete my education and enjoy my time in sunny San Diego.  After graduating I was tasked with finding a career that I truly enjoyed and that would also provide me with the opportunity to live comfortably for the rest of my life.  The stresses of this event were compounded by the fact that I lost my father to cancer a few months prior to graduation.  This would mean that I have to contribute to my family financially and emotionally during a time that was meant to be unique and special.  I went from enjoying the college life to stressing about the future. The loss of my father had a profound impact on my studies and my view of the world. My mother and sister flew in from far away to watch me graduate. We spent the week together sightseeing and visiting places that we would enjoy.  We also visited places that my father would have enjoyed seeing such as Naval museums and where he used to live.  It was an emotional graduation ceremony because we all knew how hard I had worked over the past six years and that my father was not there to see it through.  There were many ups and downs, including transferring from a community college to a good university, family health issues, as well as money issues.  All of these issues and triumphant events made the graduation ceremony much more meaningful to us all.  I still do not know where my life is headed, however this was a major stepping stone in my life's story and I am proud of my accomplishments.  As I look forward I hope to find a meaningful career that I can utilize the skills I have developed over the past several years.",True,True,True,B,True
44,"I was looking forward to being able to spend time with my nephew.  My brother and I are very close and when he got married I was really happy for him because his wife is a wonderful person.  I knew they'd be great parents, like ours were, so it was with great excitement and anticipation that I accepted their offer to babysit for them while they took a much needed week-long break from work and parenting.  My brother doesn't live far away, so I drove down in my car, which I figured would be good anyway for getting around and taking my nephew for walks in the park.  When I arrived, my brother and his wife were very excited to see me!  They were nearly bubbling over with enthusiasm for my arrival.  I mean, I knew we were close, but this was unusual, even for them.  It should have tipped me off that something wasn't quite right.  My nephew was taking a nap at the time and it gave us a chance to go over all of the things I needed to know to take care of him.  There was a lot to learn!  Much more than I had anticipated.  There were the bottles, and the cleaning and the feedings and the medications and what to do if he's crying.  That was when I should have known what was up.  It turned out that my nephew had a very bad case of colic, and had been so for some months.  He was only 9 months old at the time, but man did he have a set of lungs on him.  I don't know if you've ever cared for a baby that has colic, but boy can they be loud.   My brother and his wife gathered their things, thanked me and hugged me and pretty much ran out the door.  From the moment the door closed it seemed like my nephew never stopped crying!  I tried everything to get him to stop, from feeding, to playing to rocking him.  It was pretty much non-stop crying - and now I knew why they had looked the way they did.  In the end, I discovered a great tactic for calming the crying.  It seems my nephew loved to ride in my car!  So, whenever the crying got too much, even in the middle of the night, I just loaded him in the car and drove around the block a few times.  That did the trick!  I was never so happy to see someone than I was when my brother returned from their vacation.",False,False,False,B,True
45,"My son just turned 18, so I decided to take him and his friends to New York, about 3 months ago. The drive took about eight hours and we were all hungry. We went to an amazing Japanese restaurant on Times Square. The food was great. My son loved it. Although I think a few of his friend would have rather ate pizza. After eating, we decided to check into a hotel for the night. We were all very tired from the drive and just wanted to relax. Yet, the excitement was evident, as we all had tickets to see the Broadway show, ""Lion King"". I don't think anyone got a full nights sleep. In the morning, we all ate a huge breakfast at the hotel. We decided to take the subway to see the show. I think this was a first time experience for everyone.  After exiting the subway, we walked two city blocks to the show. The show was absolutely amazing. The sounds and actors were brilliant.  This was the high point of the trip. After the show, we ate pizza on Times Square. Then we returned to the hotel to check out.

In total we had eight people from our friends group. We created two four-man groups of varying skill levels. Beforehand we also made a handful of bets on the round. We competed closely all day long, but eventually my team won by two strokes. I ended up making a significant putt on the final hole to guarantee our victory. By the end of the day we had a downright blast on the course during our five hour round. This event will stick out for me as one of the most memorable golf experiences I've had in years. I would have no issue speaking on it further. I would say this event was mainly important to me because of how lately many of our friends have been busy with their own lives, so it was unique to have everyone available for such a long period of time on the same day. No matter how busy some of us were, everyone managed to make time for friends on this day. With everyone getting older and busier, this is a rare occurrence these days.

People or animals come into our lives and leave us as well pretty normally but few are truly special. That brings me to why I feel like I do today. Around two months ago I lost my friend someone close and I loved. It was my companion dog Buddy, the best dog a person could every have. Buddy was brought into my life from love and at a time when I needed him the most. He was caring and loving and was always by my side, loyal in every way possible. I needed him the most when he came to me to pull me back to happiness. He came to me and even though it was brief he lead me back to happiness. I don't know if I just got lucky to have him but he made an impact in my life that I have rarely felt. As I reflect back now in a state of sadness I am also happy. I know that sounds strange but I am happy because I knew him but sad because I lost him as well. I can only thank the lord for bringing him to me and showing me that I can be okay.

77,my daughter joined boyscouts just recently in february of this year. that is when they let girls join so she is a founder of the troop. since she has joined she has worked super hard to first make scout rank then tenderfoot. she also attended summer camp and worked on badges. anyway about three weeks ago was her court of honor. that is where they reconize the girls and the moms for all the hard work because scouts is family base. anyway at the court of honor when she made tenderfoot i went up also and she pinned a rank pin on me. thats part of it as we are scout moms and get reconition also. i was so proud of her and so proud of us. now i was really suprised how many badges the girls earned. they earned so many in so little time. being a scout mom makes me so proud. it makes me proud of what my daughter is achieving and also what she is learning along the way. this was a very memorable event and im its only one of many more to come. we will see what is next.,True,True,True,B,True

There was a mass shooting at our local high school. It left 17 of our students dead, and many more injured. It has been really, really hard for us as a community. While I work with students, luckily I did not lose any I knew. Anyway, so the event I'm specifically writing about happened maybe 2 months ago: it's been a while since the shooting itself, but the scars will always be there. The PTSD. All of it. So we were sitting in our church service, specifically for students, when something happens. I don't know if it was a mic error, or someone dropped something that echo'd, but there was a loud POP. It was loud. One of our students who had been injured in the shooting heard it, and he RAN. He ran and ran. He left the building completely before he recognized that it was okay, he was fine. It was heartbreaking to see - a year and a half later, how much destruction was in our community still. I can't believe it happened to this day.",True,True,True,B,True

I was kind of surprised when I came back to the apartment after spending the weekend with my folks to see that they had moved all their stuff out.  I mean Sally was actually there cleaning up the bathroom.  She looked at me really flustered and angry.  I asked her ""whats up"", she huffs on how I'm such a procrastinator and she's doing all the cleaning because Tasha is ghosting her.  I asked Sally, what are you talking about?  Did we get robbed? Where's all your stuff? and then ""Oh, didn't Tasha tell you, that we have to be out of the apartment by Tuesday?""  Honestly, my jaw dropped.

88,"A few months ago my daughter and I decided to take a nice leisurely drive through the swamps that surround our home. I remember it being such a beautiful day. The sort of day where the sky is a brilliant blue and the sun is just shinning down and it feels like there's absolutely no way anything could possibly go wrong. Well, to my shock things did go quite wrong. As we drove through the swamp land, me being careful to stay on the well marked roads because I wanted to make sure to keep my daughter safe I found that the roads were actually torn apart. Since I hadn't realized this in a timely fashion I ended up flipping the car off of the side of the road into the mud. Thankfully both my daughter and I were both still awake after this and not hurt badly. But I realized that we were hopelessly stuck as the doors had been jammed shut and I felt something pressing against me so I couldn't really move my left arm at all. I called for emergency services and fortunately they arrived quite quickly and were able to easily and efficiently get both of us out of the car and transported to the hospital. At the hospital the on call doctor did a full workup of both of us to make sure there was no lasting damage. Fortunately the doctor was not able to find anything seriously wrong with either of us. When I think back to that day that is probably the one outcome that I'm most thankful for seeing how many different ways this could have wound up being so much worse. Once we were discharged from the hospital I did some research on the roads in that area since I had always known them to be safe and never troublesome I was quite upset about what happened. After some extensive research I learned that the company had been pumping the swamps the last few days but had neglected to put up any sort of caution signs or do the required testing. This lack of signage is what directly lead to our accident and did not allow road users to be properly aware of a very important ongoing situation. I immediately notified my state's authorities of the issues that were going on with the company in the hopes that they would be able to help prevent something similiar happening to someone else. I understand that it's always best to try to help out others and by getting up proper notifications and warnings I would be helping many others in the long run avoid getting through what we did and possible even suffering from a worse outcome.",False,False,False,B,True

91,"Every five years, a large event occurs in which thousands and thousands of people from my religion come together to fellowship, worship, and spend time together. Ten years ago, I attended it for the first time. Five years ago, I was one of the few selected to help be responsible for running all of the background events, activities, and safety. At that time, I thought it would be last one I was able to attend due to future work and school commitments. However, several weeks ago, my friend surprised me with the information that we would be able to go and participate, even if it were for only a few days instead of the entire week. I was so excited that I would be able to go and at least participate in some of the activities. We found a group of friends that agreed to host us and provide us with a place to camp (everyone camps out at this event) and feed us. The large evening meetings were the most impactful however. Since we were unable to go for the entire week, I had watched some of the previous programming on the live stream available. But the feeling and experience were not the same. With our group of friends, we managed to get seats right at the front which allowed for a one of a kind view. In years past, I had never been able to sit that close. The evening of the program, while we were sitting close, I could feel the emotion and inspiration around me and on the stage with the programming. When it came time to sing the theme song one last time, everyone was on their feet singing along, shouting the words as loudly as possible. It was dark, so the only lights were on the stage at that time, but turning a looking back it was a sea of starlight (provided by the flashlights on everyone's phones). It was beautiful sight to behold. It made me feel a sense of belonging and community, even though the majority of the people present I probably have never and never would meet.

92,"Last month my daughter had to undergo emergency bladder surgery. She was born with Spina Bifida, therefore she's had bladder and bowel issues since birth.

This isn't the first time it's happened, it's the third. Her urologist told me that when a patient has that many ruptures, the bladder is no good and they'll have to install an ileochimney. An ileochimney is a stoma created where they pull out part of the bladder and she will have to wear a bag on the outside of her bladder to catch the urine coming out. One good thing about it is that she won't have to catheterize anymore, so that's a bright point. I always cry when she gets sick but this time I really wailed, because I hate seeing her going through pain and knowing it might not be the last time.

Aside from hanging out on the beach all day, we also went to out to eat at some very nice restaurants. I got to eat some fresh seafood. We're from Ohio so the seafood we can get in Florida is not like the seafood we can get in Ohio. On one of the nights we went out to play miniature golf.

She was in labor and despite everything, she wasn't progressing like she should have been. We were there 15 hours before the doctor said she was going to need a c-section. I fought against it and so did Susan. We wanted a natural birth! The doctor urged more and we ended up allowing it.

It seemed like a normal calm day like any other day. That mornings calmness was shattered when I heard a loud thump and  shortly after the sound of my step mother screaming  for me.

Without even thinking I called 911 and tried to do CPR on my dad while the ambulance came. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the paramedics to arrive. Once they did though it seemed like someone hit the fast forward button. They showed up and asked what all had happened then got to work on my dad. They worked on him for what seemed like a minute but in reality was more like 10 minutes. They decided that they needed to rush him to the hospital to try to do anything more that they could. My step mother went with them while I stayed behind and cleaned up the mess the paramedics had made as well as to call family members and let them know what was going on.  About 2 or 3 hours later I got the news that my father had passed away.  The doctors tried everything they could and they would get his heart started and he would be stable for a minute or two before it would stop. It got to the point where the doctors had said that they could keep on working and try to stabilize him as best as they could but with how much time had passed that even if they could his braid had been without oxygen for so long that he would have been basically brain dead and would have been on machines for the rest of his life.

The play was fast and furious and very quickly a fight started. I had to remove Kate from the game because she was the one who started the fight with a player from Ohio State. The referee also confirmed that Kate started it. Later, I had also talked to Ohio State's captain (Brenda) about the fight after she had talked to her player (Ann) who was the victim of the fight. I couldn't believe it but Kate actually was pissed about it when I confronted her after the game and claimed I didn't believe her. This isn't like Kate, but I know she just broke up with her boyfriend and has been argumentative with most of us so I've basically written it off as a one-shot problem with her. In the last six months, she's finally been her normal self with everyone including me. Anyway, a couple of my teammates and I were at a party and a video of that particular game was being played and I watched that fight again. I'm very frustrated at myself.

It was Ann who started the fight very subtly and unnoticeable but definitely showed running the video slowly. The referee, Ohio State's captain and I were all wrong and Ann, the player had lied.

I was looking for jobs at the time, but they were hard to come by. I sent out countless resumes and applications but to no avail. I signed up for online job posting sites and looked for jobs on Craigslist.

After work, he would always drink a few beers to relax. After my father had the stroke, he past away a few months after. It really hurt me to see him die fairly young, and it devastated my family. I could not function properly after he died, and it left me depressed. It left me to a point where I started drinking myself, just to let the pain go of him not being here anymore. I had to tell myself that drinking was not the answer, and he would want me to move on, and continue to make him proud by being successful in life. It was a very painful time in my life.

Not only because of the scenery which was amazing, but because I learned to appreciate my dad as well as be more patience towards him and accept his ""shticks"" as I am sure I have them too. He was very proud of me for planning the trip so perfectly to make sure we go to the right places and not miss a thing. We started our trip in San Francisco and drove all night to Yosemite. Then we planned to go to Bristlecone Pine Forest, Death Valley, Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Antelope Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Zion Park and back to Las Vegas and all along to road visited other various attractions. Even though I planned it, it was semi spontaneous trip with food, lodging etc. Many of these places are places I only dreamed of or saw in the movies and I am know that my dad was in awe of everything. We took tons of photos and sadly the video camera didn't record anything, even though we thought it was recording - apparently there was some defect in it. Regardless, my dad keeps talking about places we've been and things we've seen and he's keep referring back to the photos (he even print some of them on canvas to hang in his house).You see, my dad lives overseas so this trip was more than just bonding experience, it was first time I have to see him for a very very long time.

132,"Two months ago I had the honor and privilege to work as an intern for the immigration clinic in my home state.  The work was very hard but rewarding.  There is one case in my mind that sticks out in particular and that is the case of Client. (name omitted).  Every week, the intern group would head to local facilities where immigrants seeking asylum were held.  The group would give a presentation to the detainees about the services we provided and their rights as detainees.  At the end of the presentation,  one man walked directly up to me and began telling me his story.  The man said that he was from Eritrea.  He had been a professor there, and was persecuted for speaking out against the local government.  He had been jailed in a facility without windows for seven months and was subsequently released to return to work as a professor, this time with government agents sitting in on all of his lectures.  After one session in particular, Client felt as if he was going to be arrested and imprisoned again, and he set out to flee Eritrea, which he did successfully.  With the help of a false passport (his home government had confiscated his), and extended travels through three countries, Client arrived in America where he was subsequently detained.  After hearing his story, I decided to take him on as a client to help him gain asylum.  Over the course of 4 weeks I studied endlessly, learning everything there was to know about Client and asylum laws. A great deal of time was also spent with Client rehearsing the details of his long and harrowing journey and detailing the precise reasons he needed to be granted asylum.  At the end of the four weeks, the moment of truth arrived.  I entered the courtroom with Client and waited patiently.  After what seemed to be an eternity, our case was finally in front of the judge.  They called Client to the stand and we began the direct examination.  The examination was perfect.  Everything that Client and I had prepared for was executed seamlessly.  We were so thorough and convincing that the other examining party had minimal questions for Client and gave minimal push back to the idea that asylum was absolutely necessary for my client.  We received the news last month that Client has been granted asylum, and I can honestly say that hearing that news was one of the greatest moments of my life.",True,True,True,B,True

The performers were top notch and it was a night of first class music. The vocals were melodic and the playing ability of the musicians was the best you would find anywhere. Even though the tickets were rather expensive for my budget it was money well spent. I would do it again in a minute. As a matter of fact, I am keeping an eye out for the next concert! Also, my love of music has caused me to recently decide to purchase a guitar. My goal was to become capable enough to surprise my granddaughter. She has taken up playing the guitar and I wanted to be able to bond with her through music. She is now a teenager and communication is not as easy. Well, I have been practicing very hard for the past few months. So recently on her birthday, I surprised her with a birthday song. She was shocked and excited.  I hope to soon get her to attend some concerts with me as well as we both have a love of music.",False,False,True,B,False

162,"Recently, I have connected with my oldest brother whom I have never met. I have always known that I have an older brother from a marriage that my Dad had before my Mother.  I had found my oldest brother on Facebook years ago and tried to reach out to him then. Unfortunately, at that time, he was uninterested in knowing me or my brothers. Recently though, about 3 months ago, my brother reached out to my Mom and let her know that if my brothers or I wanted to contact him, we could. I ended up messaging him on Facebook and have been talking to him ever since. It's strange how very similar we are and how much we look alike as well. This contact with my estranged brother has brought about MANY emotions that I never knew that I had. Our father passed away in 2014 and talking to my brother has in some ways resurfaced my grief. I've also felt joy, happiness and a feeling of connection with him that I never knew that I could. Also, we ended up getting in touch with each other around the five year anniversary of Dads death and that felt like a punch in the gut. It was my Father who chose not to have contact with my brother and in a lot of ways, I feel terrible for him. My dad was amazing to me and my full blooded brothers but for my oldest brother, Dad was never there and now there will never be a chance for him to make amends to him. My oldest brother would never know the joy that my Dad brought to the people around him. My Dad was an amazing man with many flaws, like us all but he was still caring, intelligent, kind and most importantly, he was my Dad. My oldest brother will ONLY ever know him as the man who was never there for him. As for the most memorable part of this event, it has to be the joy that I have felt reconnecting with my brother as well as the grief and pain. In a lot of ways, he and I are so very similar. We like the same kind of music, we play the same games, we have the same type of humor. My full blooded brothers both take a lot more after our Mom but I look so much like my Dad.

163,"I will never forget the day my life changed. My five year son had been acting odd peeing the bed, excessively drinking and eating a ton of food for about two weeks so I decided to take him in to the doctor. I was sitting  in the physician's office waiting on his urine test result when she came in to tell us yes there was glucose in his urine and next we would do a finger stick. The fingerstick reading was 562. We were in utter shock as she told us we needed to rush him to the hospital immediately and could not stop at home to grab clothes. In the ER the antibody tests were run, we were told we would need to stay in the hospital for three days for Type one diabetes training. I stared at my little boy in the hospital bed hooked up to an IV in disbelief. I could not believe that just hours ago I had given him breakfast without a care in the world and now he would need insulin with each meal to even survive. It was so hard to wrap my head around the fact that without insulin my child would die and he would need it for the rest of his life. The next days were filled with holding down a crying five year old giving him shots, him tearfully asking when his diabetes would go away and me sneaking in to the hospital bathroom to cry. It was a time of grieving the life that he would never have, a life without insulin. It was a time of sorting thru the mess and finding hope as well. Seeing the tiny triumphs of him not crying thru his last finger pokes in the hospital and his excitement to leave the hospital behind and just head back to being a child with a few minor adjustments. As much as that time shook me to my core and brought me to my knees with grief I also saw strength and hope in a child that I never imagined I would see.

186,"Dear Diary,It has been almost 4 months since I've started my new job. I couldn't be any happier. Since graduating from college last year, job searching had been extremely difficult for me. I am painfully introverted with social anxiety, so finding a job that I was both comfortable with  and suited my degree had been a daunting task. Before landing my current job, I had two other jobs in the past year. I ended up quitting both of them in less than a month, unfortunately. My previous position was a warehouse associate. I quit in January. The period of unemployment between then and July was extremely stressful for me. I had student loans that I'd been putting off, and I felt incredibly guilty living that I was home doing nothing, while my parents were working. I'm sure that had I send in hundred of applications through Indeed, Linkedin, and Glassdoor, but I just wasn't getting any responses. I finally received a callback in July, and luckily, I got the job! I love it here, my hours are great, and even though I have coworkers, most of the time I am working on my own! I'm hoping to buy a car by the end of this year, and move into my own apartment by the fall of next year.

I was thinking how in the world would I even live without him if he had passed on. These were horrible thoughts in my head! It all started when my dad started to feel ill. He said he was feeling week and a little shakey. I told him to go to bed for a little bit and maybe he'd feel better after a nap. He laid down, but an hour later he got back up and told me ""I think I need to go to the hospital."" I asked him if he was feeling better, he said he was feeling worse and would feel better going to the hospital. I got dressed and got him dressed and we went to the hospital. The nurse asked for his symptoms and started getting a concerned look on her face when he was saying he had a tightness in his chest a few days before and that now he just felt weaker and weaker. She told him, ""I think you both should be prepared to spend the night tonight. I get a hunch that this is serious."" and I looked at her and said ""What do you mean?"" and she said she'd get a doctor to explain everything. The doctor came in about 5 minutes later and said they were going to take my father down to do some tests and then asked him how he was feeling and he mumbled ""Not good."" So they took him out and the doctor stayed with me and explained everything and how he might have had a heart attack, but won't know until he does the tests. I asked if it was serious and he said ""It could be."" Turns out, he had had one and was getting what they said was ""kick backs"" from the first attack. The tests showed that it was worse than expected and my dad had to be wheeled into surgery for quintuple bypass surgery . I was so nervous for him, this was the most serious thing he had ever been through and it was scary for us all.

192,"I had recently found myself in quite a terrifying quandary. I have been accustomed to some level of violence, growing up in an impoverished neighborhood... but this, was different. About 4 weeks ago, I was struck by an oncoming vehicle in a high speed accident. It happened so quickly, that I initially thought I was okay. It wasn't til about 30 seconds after the accident that I realized the side of my shoulder and my arm had 2 severe gashes. These weren't scrapes or cuts, but inch deep wounds that were 2 inches in length. I panicked, never imagined the reality of injuries that bad to myself. No one else was injured somehow, even though the other persons vehicle had 3 people in it, and I was just by myself.  If I would have had a passenger, they would have likely been hit on their left arm and possibly had organ damage near the chest area. By the time I got to the hospital, I already lost a lot of blood and felt dizzy. I was awake the entire time they were stitching my arm and shoulder but I had a painkiller shot. I remember feeling interested in the wound after I got the painkiller shot and it was being stitched up. I'm thankful that nobody else was injured, and that I wasn't killed or permanently injured. Although, it did end up being the other drivers fault, and his insurance had to buy me a new car because mine was totaled. This was one of the most traumatic experiences that has ever happened to me in my life. That being said, I would feel way worse about it, if someone intentionally did it to me.

It's only a few blocks down the street, I know it's cold but we could bundle up and totally make it there!"" Ben hesitated but nodded, knowing it was the best chance at a delicious anniversary dinner. We ran back inside and grabbed our scarves, wrapping them around our faces leaving only a tiny hole to see from. We started walking and realized it was even colder than we thought... there was no choice but to huddle up together as we walked and hold each other to keep as warm as possible. We finally made it there, red faced, and ready to order some hot tea. The waitress was impressed that we were willing to walk over in such cold weather! We took a chance and ordered something that we had never had before, and out came the most delicious sushi we had ever consumed! We agreed that this was our new favorite place, and we were so happy that it was right next to our apartment! It was also so nice that we were cuddling in public, as normally we are very shy and don't like any sort of public displays of affection. It was a new milestone for our relationship, and we are even closer now, casting aside our fears and starting to do things like hug and hold hands in public! I had such a wonderful anniversary and I'm very happy that we get to bond more and more every year! :)",False,False,False,B,True
220,"It happened so fast. 12 weeks ago, I was eating normal and working out everyday. I started feeling chest pains daily but never really paid any attention to it. I would come home and eat dinner with my family and talk to them about it. I went to a doctor but they didn't see anything. I went out running one day, and my chest started hurting really bad. I started grasping it onto my chest and I called 911. They reported to my location almost immediately. I was able to call my family, but I couldn't speak so they couldn't get told til a paramedic arrived. They hauled me to the hospital where they luckily got me taken care of. My whole family was there which made the process a lot better. I wasn't able to go to work and help my family out with that, but thankfully we had savings. It was a terrible feeling.

I was so shocked to see him  He not only came to visit but he surprised me by bringing me soup he made at home!  He knew I was not doing too good and he came to cheer me up and give me company.  Having him there showed me that I have people that still care about me.  We talked for a long time and it was obvious to me that he wanted nothing in return.  It was nice to be able to open up about myself to someone who I know I can trust.  Greg convinced me to make an appointment to see a doctor.  He wants me to feel better, and I do too!

Labor were relatively easy and seeing my daughter after anticipating her arrival brought me so much joy. However I began to feel a bit different from usual. Sure, we all have bad days and no one is 100 percent happy all the time but my level of happiness started to decrease. The beautiful baby I had became a afterthought as I only wanted to curl up in bed and just sleep my life away. I had little to no energy , my emotions started to significantly go down and I just did not care anymore. Not only about my child but myself and others around me. Thanks to my husband who helped me tremendously during the days I want to give up, including giving up my own child! It was a very emotional time and I finally worked up the courage to see the doctor about what I were feeling. He told me I was suffering post partum depression. Beforehand I looked up the signs and most of symptoms ticked off the checkbox. He began medication for me and offered therapy if I choose to go that route. I accepted it because I refused to live my life feeling numb constantly. I wanted to be here for my daughter, loved ones, and took active steps to make it sure I am able to provide emotional care.

224,The perfect summer day with my niece.  The day started out with my niece and I going to IHOP to get breakfast.  She loves pancakes so IHOP was the perfect place for her to eat.  We both had a large stack of pancakes and left the restaurant feeling great.  After breakfast we went to a early movie.  The Lion King was playing and she really wanted to see it.  Since I had seen the original I thought it would be interesting to take her to see the new version.  I bought the tickets and we went in and got popcorn and drinks.  We found some seats in the middle of the theater and sat back to enjoy the movie.  The movie was really good and brought back memories from my childhood.  My niece also loved the movie.  It was now mid afternoon and we decide to go to the skating rink.  Both her and I like to skate so it was a good way to pass the time.  After about a 20 minute drive we arrived at the rink and noticed that the parking lot was not too full.  That was good because it would mean the rink had less people on it and more space to skate.  We went inside and rented our skates.  We spent the next three hours blissfully skating in a nice oval direction.  The music was good and it was not that crowded so the experience was really nice.  When skating I never seem to get tired.  I think it is because I enjoy it so much.  When we left the skating rink it was late afternoon and we were hungry so I took her to Chi Fil A to get some sandwiches.  She loves that restaurant.  We took the food home and waited for her father to get off work.  After eating the food and spending time with her father my niece fell asleep on the couch.

We were all responsible for researching trails or places that we wanted to visit while we were there.   We hiked at Bell Rock and heard people playing the bagpipes while we were standing at the top of the rock.  It was awesome.  We drove to the Grand Canyon to watch the sunrise with complete strangers and it was amazing.  We slide down the rocks at Slide Rock State Park which was hands-down my favorite place of the trip and possibly any place I've ever been.  We went on an 8 mile hike in the Coconino National Forest just to say we hiked it.  The trip was extremely fast but we also took time to relax and enjoy the Arizona weather and beautiful scenery.  I was happy that it was a girls trip, but I was also sad that my husband and kids weren't with me.  My kids especially would have enjoyed Arizona, in particular Slide Rock State Park.

It was my first time ever being to the nation's capital, and with one day before my husband's surgery, we attempted to walk all over downtown DC and see as many monuments as possible before we had to be back at Walter Reed and ready for surgery the next morning. We traveled downtown on the Metro, and ended up getting off a short distance from the Capital, where we started.

The thing that stood out to me about the monuments was the realization that the Lincoln Memorial literally just had Lincoln's statue in it. I seriously thought that there might be more, maybe a museum commemorating his achievements or something, but it really had just his statue. I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone. What also stuck out to me while we were downtown was the World War 2 Memorial. I honestly didn't expect to be impressed by that memorial.

257,"This happened about 3 months ago.  I was driving with my brother back from the movie theater when we were sideswiped by another car.  It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying.  It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures.  We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop.  We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were.  We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay.  They other driver got out of their car and were obviously under the influence.  You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away.  My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought.  The other driver looked to be in his mid 20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police.  The police go there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed miserably.  I exchanged information with on of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come.  The other driver was arrested and my car was towed away.  It is the only major accident I've ever been in besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots.  Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay.  It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for.

I said ""of course"" because Jesse loved people and any attention he got from them. The little girl rubbed his ears and gave him a kiss.

264,"Six months ago, I made the huge decision to move out of my parents‚Äô home and into my own place. I lived in the same house since I was born and have two younger sisters who are in high school. I went to a college out-of-state but returned home for breaks. I had graduated college three months before (nine months ago) and landed a steady full-time salaried job four weeks after graduation. Since I was living at home, my expenses were generally low and I saved up a good amount of money. I started out looking for one-bedroom apartments around my city that I knew I could comfortably afford each month. I didn‚Äôt tell my parents I was starting the apartment search and they hadn‚Äôt asked about any timeline for doing so. I was concerned that my parents would be sad that I was leaving home as we are very close and I help out with my sisters. However, I was tired of not having privacy to spend time with my long-time boyfriend. I was also bothered every night to spend time with my family after I returned home from a long day at work and just wanted to relax. It was time to spread my wings and put down new roots of my own. After looking at three apartments, I decided on a very nice remodeled building with a parking space for my car and large windows with lots of light and closet space. I signed the papers and put down the deposit, still without talking to my parents. The next day, I sat down with them at dinner while my sisters were out at school activities and gently treaded the waters of telling them I was thinking of moving out to see how they would respond before giving them all the details. I waited for frowns or tears but both of them stood up and hugged me. They asked if I needed any help or recommendations for a new place but I explained that I already found one and would be moving in two weeks. They were surprised, but overjoyed. They told me I was a good daughter and deserved to have my own space and make my mark on the world. They helped me move and my mom was thrilled to help decorate.

265,"Since my own mother died when I was younger, I have become close to my husband's mother and maintain an affectionate correspondence with her. She is not my mom but I love her for who she is all the same. In the past few months my mother-in-law has been quite ill. In the last month, I learned that she has stage 2 borderline stage 3 lung cancer involving a large mass in the lung. I saw her last week for the first time since her diagnosis when she stopped to spend a night with us while on her to begin cancer treatment. She was in good spirits despite the long journey. She joked about death and mentioned doing her 'dying person' prayers. Being a feminist and an incredibly open-minded person, she was extremely supportive towards me and my unconventional career choices, encouraging me. Everything felt suspended in disbelief and she was filled with more tenderness than usual. In a way this surprised me because she has many reasons to be angry: with her doctors or with life in general for striking her with cancer, in addition to many other misfortunes. She was relaxed and calm and put on a good face but she also looked frail and had lost a significant amount of weight. The next morning she got up early and when we said goodbye to her, she seemed so small and impotent and alone. She looked at both of us directly - her son and me - and somehow I felt that we all understood what is at stake here. As she drove off I wondered if I would see her again. Her visit and seeing her has made me feel many things. I grieve that she has to face this terrible disease and I feel a deep sorrow for my husband, who has been sleeping poorly, worried and more quiet than usual. He would not be who he is today -- respectful towards women, kind, loving, patient -- if it were not for his mother. He does not want to lose her. I feel a sense of total powerlessness in the face of death and the passage of time. I think about how my mother-in-law has lived this amazing, full life, always doing what she wanted even when it was the controversial choice. I think about the vast emptiness of not being able to talk to her again or to be able to email her or see her. I think about how I could have visited her last year but chose not to because it was too cold and rainy where she lived, and I assumed I would have many more chances to see her. I think about how all of us are suspended in disbelief in every moment, unsure about when death will happen to us.

It was awesome hanging out with my bros like were were young again. I hadn't seen Andy in over a decade, and he has been so depressed, on that day he was as giddy as could be. My friend George had a very rough time and did not have fun, while Chad took care of him. Bob took the most of all, and was having a blast in his own world.

It was fantastic, I was able to work out many of my anxiety and panic issues on that day, or at least identify why they are happening better. It was incredibly therapeutic. More so than any traditional therapy by far. The drug allowed me to look at my thoughts from a new perspective, and I was able to see things so clearly I could not at all before within my mind and how it functions. I am a much better person for it, and feel more mentally sound than I have in years. The day ended slowly without much commotion, but we all had a blast.

She asked me to do so on her behalf, because it was a surprise gift for their anniversary, and she did not want him to know that she was doing it.

My brother start to discuss his journey and why he was here. I could gather that he was homesick and was not about to miss another holiday without celebrating with his family. Young and old, I could see smiling faces and positive interactions. As the day came to a close, I was pulled aside by my brother to learn his health scare. I was sworn into secrecy. I knew there was another reason behind his visit as the holidays though approaching were still several weeks away. I was happy that he did want to be with his family at this time of sadness.

I was sad to hear he was divorced, but also not suprised. He seemed happy though. I was great to be able to dance and have fun while hearing about what everyone was doing now. Some how Bob got talked into providing the music just like back in college. But as usual he was right on point and knew just the type of music to keep us dancing until late into the night.

377,"""I attended college an hour and a half from home, and a few times during the semester my dad would pick me up on Fridays so I could come home and visit for the weekend. We were on the interstate driving home, when my dad starts to tell me a story about a time when he was in the Army. I forget the precise details, but it was basically about how he and some buddies went out on the town one evening and had a few drinks. ... The tale becomes a bit more serious and personal all of the sudden  like he's pouring his heart out to me. My dad then says that he and his friends ran into another group of guys and got into an argument. The fight supposedly turned physical, with my dad throwing some punches at one of these guys. Then my dad, in the most serious tone possible, tells me that he grabbed the guy and pushed him off a cliff. The guy died and my dad and his friends managed to cover up the whole sordid tale from the police ‚Äî this was the first time he'd ever admitted it to another living soul outside of that night. At this point, I'm horrified. Is my dad just confessing a murder to me? Was this mild-mannered man radically different when he was a 20-year-old kid? Do I tell my mom? Do I tell the police? Do I ask him to stop the car? Finally something in the story actually sunk in the part about 'pushing him off a cliff.' My dad was stationed in Louisiana when he was in the military and while I'd never been there, I was pretty sure there weren't that many cliffs. I finally said, ''Wait a minute, a cliff?' I'd been avoiding even looking at him since he made his 'confession,' but now that I looked over, he was about ready to explode. No longer able to hold it, he started laughing hysterically and kept saying, 'I can't believe you fell for it! You thought I killed a guy! April Fool's.",True,True,True,B,True

I appreciate actual life and I understand that there is a 'grey area' between conception and birth, I don't think it's fair for a government or an authoritative figure to make decisions about the woman and future baby. While a man was involved at some point, the gestation is entirely owned by the woman. There are all different kinds of extenuating circumstances and not every person handles situations the same. Some women don't want to have children at all, or by a rapist, or are homeless or drug additcted or just regular happy people and don't believe bringing a child into this world is the right thing for them at at time.

380,"Earlier this summer, I went to Denver for the first time since cannabis was legalized. I took the train (because I'm not a big fan of flying) from Chicago to Denver which took about 20 hours. It was by far the longest I've ever spent on a train, and I was super happy to finally get off in Denver, but the ride wasn't so bad. It's way more comfortable than flying because the seats are bigger, with lots of legroom and you can get up to walk around. They even have an observation car with giant windows, although it was usually crowded. Nobody was sitting next to me, so I had tons of room. And there was free wi-fi, so I watched Netflix and did all the normal things on my computer that I would have done if I was at home. All in all it was a pleasant ride. When I got to Denver, I had a few hours to kill before I could check into my hotel room. So I decided I would walk the 5 miles from the train station to the hotel. There just happened to be a nice bike/walking path along a creek that covered most of the distance. It wasn't in a hurry and it was a hot day, so I took my time. I saw lots of breaks to sit and watch the cyclists and joggers pass by. When I finally got to the hotel, I was pretty sweaty and red in the face, and I still had a little more time to kill. So I found a bathroom and freshened up and relaxed in the lounge for a bit. Then I checked in and went to my room. From a quick internet search I saw that there were about 5 dispensaries all within walking distance from my hotel and I could see 3 of them from my room. So I picked the one that had the best reputation and went to buy legal cannabis for the first time. When you first walk into the dispensary, it looks like a boring waiting room. You give your ID to someone and then they buzz you into the main room where everything is for sale. Then you assigned a ""budtender"" who helps you choose what you want to buy. I had no idea what I wanted, so that was helpful. I ended up buying some edibles, which I tried that night.

397,"My son has been battling drug addiction for the last several years. Although he has been experimenting with drugs, mainly smoking marijuana, he did not develop a serious addiction until he moved from our home in Florida to Chicago. There he became intimate with a meth dealer and got so deep in addiction that he lost his job and then his apartment and for most of the remainder of his time in Chicago he was virtually homeless, sleeping on friends' couches and occasionally in the park. Last November my husband and I helped him come back to Florida, thinking it was his best chance to get clean. Unfortunately, in our hometown meth, my son's drug of choice, seems to be available on every corner and in every bar. He would manage to not use for a few days and then would jump right back in, sometimes for days at a time. On at least one occasion he stayed up using meth and other substances for a straight seven day period. In April his addiction reached critical mass and he attempted suicide in his desperation. A good friend of his, a recovering alcoholic himself, helped my son get into a detox facility in a nearby town and then to their rehab center. After that he lived for a few months in a recovery home and has done very well since. Three weeks ago, his half bother on his dad's side of his family hung himself and did not survive. My son was devastated as they were very close. He handled it extremely well but I was concerned that this tragic even could trigger a relapse. Shortly after that his roommate ended up in the hospital with liver problems. Last week he called me and told me that he had indeed relapsed, but that, thankfully, it was a one time event and was not his usual meth, but cocaine. He also reached out to his sponsor and to his counselor at the rehab center. Even though he did relapse I was not devastated or overly disappointed as I would have been in the past. Relapse is a common thing in drug and alcohol recovery and he had some serious triggers confront him in a short period of time. I told my son not to beat himself up over his relapse and stressed how proud I was of the way he handled it. To the best of my knowledge he has continued to go to meetings and maintain close contact with his sponsor.

I had a lot to do but I had just enough time to pull it all off and make the day a success.  One of the difficult parts of the day was getting started on some of dishes for dinner later.

When I go to the store I notice that there are no signs at the store indicating the deals in the ad.  When I went to check out my fears came to fruition when my discounts and free items were all rang in full price.

Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications.

I had just sat down with her around my birthday, and while she mentioned having back pain, she was still sharp as a knife and not sick.

Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six.

As we waited for the police I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back, but because I was the one merging I was going to be at fault.  I thought more and more about it and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room. As things progressed, I was ticketed and I talked to the other driver and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost. She said that they were alright and were okay and then they left. Later on, I found out that they were trying to get a large settlement from my insurance company and hired a lawyer and were claiming injury.

Immediately she caught my attention since I was very attracted to her, but I simply went back to my work once a moment or two had passed. I was writing an email to a coworker when she walked by again. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see that she was heading toward the break room.

She looked so stunning and I was so proud to be her friend. The wedding was phenomenal. I played cello at her ceremony and it was a perfect summer day in New York. The food was amazing. She had spent around $250 per person on food and it was nothing short of spectacular. I had Seafood, Salad, Filet Mignon, Duck, Salmon and eight kinds of desserts. After the wedding, we had a lot of dancing. It was a traditional Jewish Wedding and it was so energetic. It was so much fun.

460,"I had always wondered if she truly cared when she heard the diagnosis last year.  My mother and brother in law were not close, but the relationship might have been worse than I thought.  I recall my mother talking about doing certain things with my sisters husband when we first heard of the cancer, including going on a long trip together and spending more time together during the holidays.  Her plans with my brother in law gave me the impression that she really wanted to get to know him as a person, and try to relate with him on some level with the time they had left.  I was hoping the soured relationship between my sister and mother would not have interfered wit the plans they had, but that might have been the sole reason for the fall out.	My sister was a rebellious child in her teens, which is where the negative tension between her and my mother started.  This tension carried on throughout their lives, and it all came to a head when my sister married Mark.  My brother in law was a good man, however my mother did not agree with his atheist views, as she had been very religious her entire life.  I feel that my mother resented him for influencing my sisters religious views, which had become non existent over the past few years.  She stopped going to church and stopped showing up for family dinners on the holidays, which was something we did normally at least once a month.  The older you get, the more difficult it becomes to release grudges and judgments towards people.  My mother was open minded to listening what Mark believed in and why he did not believe in god, however those intentions faded as Mark‚Äôs situation got worse.  After finding out he had cancer, his attitude towards life began to change, and my mother sensed this.  She decided she did not want to be part of the negativity that surrounded my sisters family at the time, and felt it would have impacted her own religious beliefs.  	I understand why my mother distanced herself from the situation due to her relationship with god, however, life is short and I feel she regrets not visiting my sister and her husband before his death.  My mother put god before her family and has expressed to me she does feel guilty for not visiting Mark, but told me she could not sacrifice her life long commitment to Christianity.  Sometimes in life if we are going to be better people, we have to make sacrifices for others even if they make us feel uncomfortable.",False,False,False,B,True

First, we visited the shire, they wouldn't let us into the hobbit houses, but that's okay. Just getting to be there, surrounded by the mountains and scenery and sets from the movies was probably the best thing i'll ever experience. I can't believe how well they've maintained the sets in the almost two decades since the movie came out. Everything was so green and vibrant, we had so much fun. After going to the LoTR park, we got to see Flight of the Conchords! I can't believe they were in town, and the tickets ate up a bunch of my budget, but I don't care. Hearing Business Time and The Most Beautiful Girl live was so funny, Brett and Jemaine will always be two of my favorite musicians. We spent about a week seeing the other sites, it's such a beautiful country! Australia is on fire right now, it was so unbearably hot and smokey that we mostly sat around and played video games while getting stoned. We spent a lot of time catching up, talking about all the things that aren't so easy to talk about over Facebook Messenger. I got to meet his friends and his parents, and I think they liked me.

The last straw had been when he attempted to choke me, leaving bruises on my neck. For months, no one believed what happened, and a lot of former friends took his side, leaving me feeling alone and helpless. Depressed and a shadow of my former self, I stopped doing things I enjoyed and didn't get out as much. Then I met my new boyfriend and he taught me that not all people were like my ex. He helped me see that the world isn't as bad as I thought and not everyone was like that. He listened to what I had to say, taking into account what had happened and for once, someone actually believed me. He took time to listen, helping to navigate through my feelings and emotions and held my habd throughout it all. Without him there, i would still be depressed and lost.

She was there probably about 14 days in a row by now.  The nurses that were coming in and out of the room had this look on their face like they knew what was about to happen.  The background was very serene and quiet and there was momentos of the family all over the place - family pictures, fresh flowers, trinkets.  My grandmother was laying there quietly.  She was laying on her side and had her eyes closed but she was still breathing. The blankets were laying on top of her.  Her hands were cold and turning dark.

472,I was looking to buy a car but I didn't have transportation at the time so my options were limited. I finally found a BMW 328i close enough to ride my bike to see. I contacted the seller and made plans to see it that Sunday. I had been withdrawing cash every week to be sure I had enough to buy a car when I found one but I needed enough money in my bank account to cover the cost of insurance so I'd be able to drive it home. On Thursday I made certain to transfer the funds I needed well before the cutoff time. A little while later I got an email that the transfer failed. I found a reddit thread stating others were having the same problem. The withdrawal had to be done before about 5:00 or I knew it wouldn't be in my account. I tried throughout the day every 30 to 45 minutes or so hoping it would work. finally just before 4:30 the transfer finally went through. On Friday I checked my balance and found that instead of depositing my withdrawal once I had every single attempted withdrawal deposited to my account. I wasn't sure what to do since I now had over 400 extra dollars in my account and a negative balance in my Amazon payments account. I didn't know when the money might be taken out or whether they would only take the extra money or reverse it all and correct it with another deposit. The advice I kept getting was to not touch the money until it was figured out. I felt like I was in limbo and was extremely frustrated. I contacted the seller and told him I wouldn't be able to meet Sunday but if he still had it next weekend I would come get it. After a few days I finally received an email from Amazon confirming the error and that funds would not be removed from anyone's bank account. Unfortunately they weren't clear about what would happen to our Amazon payments account. I confirmed with the seller I would be able to come see the car that weekend and we set a time. One day I found the car was no longer listed and asked if it was sold. The seller replied that he had a flat tire he wasn't able to change and found the car had been towed from the apartment building he parked it at. My heart sank I felt a great opportunity had slipped out of my hands due to bad luck and felt a little bit hopeless about finding a vehicle. Amazon sent an email on Thursday stating the incorrect balance had been resolved and that the extra funds were ours to keep as an apology for the inconvenience I was completely floored that I just got a gift of over $400. A few days later I found a 525i that was listed for only a couple hundred more than the one I was planning to buy and it was a newer model by four years plus the interior looked new and the body was in pretty good condition with no major issues. After checking it over and test driving it I wound up negotiating with the guy for 100 less than the car I was previously going to buy so I wound up with $400 extra dollars and a car that was one model range up and four years newer for less money.,True,True,True,B,True

This on its own is already a sweet thing for friends to do, but for me it was especially great. I've never liked celebrating my birthday, as on the years I have celebrated my birthday, bad things have happened that day. As a result, I've built up a kind of superstition around my birthday, and usually avoid going out. I'd told my friends that this year, as per usual, I planned on having a nice quiet day, go to the gym, treat myself to some nice food, maybe take the time to make a fun cocktail for myself or buy some expensive beer. They said it was fine, but they wanted to take my out to brunch, so I acquiesced, because I knew that they saw my simple birthdays as a sad thing, despite that not being my attitude towards them. I mostly agreed for their sake, so they wouldn't be worried about me. When I left the apartment that day, I thought we'd just be getting lunch and I'd have my quiet day. Instead, one of my friends was waiting outside with a rental car. They gave me a card and told me to go back in and pack a weekend's worth of clothes. I was floored, and obviously I went back inside to pack. I felt bad they were spending so much money on me when I knew I'd never be able to do the same for them, but since everything had already been paid for, I couldn't let it go to waste. To be entirely honest, there was a small part of me that wishes they hadn't done it, because it was the exact opposite of what I asked them to do: every year I ask to not receive gifts, partly because I myself am bad at giving gifts, and partly because I know I can't afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, and would feel bad about it. This, of course, was larger than any git I'd ever received, and larger than I could ever give, and to a certain degree, inside, it bothered me. But, I knew my friends weren't looking for repayment, and they were doing it out of kindness and a genuine care for me, so I shelved my pride and let myself have fun. We went to Philly and stayed at a hotel, swam in the pool, ate awesome food, and generally lazed around for the weekend, exploring the city and seeing the sights. I got to climb the stairs of the Philly Art Museum (like in one of my favorite movies, Rocky), I got to visit Reading Terminal, and we had amazing cheesecake.

I'd say that's 8 years wasted, down the drain, but my support group says that I need to consider that addiction is an illness that never actually subsides. It will always be there with you, so it's important to be weary of triggers for relapse, but I was still an addict for those 8 years so it's not that I've failed. As you know, a year ago, my mother passed away. After she passed, her house was seized by the bank and that's where I had been living while I try to get my life in order. Karen came to the funeral and when I told her about my issues, she said she had just the thing to pick me up. I shouldn't have been hanging out with her to begin with, but with the passing of my mom, it seemed like she just wanted to reminisce about the good old days and I was really feeling the nostalgia. So, I went to the party with her and in my desperation, started drinking while we were there. It was a wild night, and I really wasn't in a good head space. I ended up passing out on the uber ride home and she had to practically carry me to my bathroom. We tipped the uber pretty well. I woke up on the bathroom floor and immediately regretted my night, but thought.. 'to hell with it' and went to the liquor store right away and stocked up. I drank for about 3 days straight thinking I'd be able to get back on the wagon myself, but those few days of acceptance led to months of acceptance and I found myself at work trying to hide my vodka in a water bottle. When my brother came to visit, he noticed all of the empty bottle in the trash and convinced me to take a week off and go to a rehab facility. I agreed and my time there was nice, they really helped me understand my triggers and forgive myself while taking responsibility for my actions. Since my release, I've been going to AA meetings and tonight I got my 60 day chip.

Thinking back to that day makes me happy to see how well her and her husband are doing now. I remember I had planned an engagement party for them. My mother and father had worked with me to set it up in our parents backyard. It was just a casual summer cookout. We let my sister and her fiance choose the list of people to invite. My sister and her fiance said they were running late. It was such a surprise to see a limo pull up to the house. My sister came out of the limousine with a wedding dress on and her fiance had a suit. So silly since the rest of us were in sundresses, flip flops, and cargo shorts. They surprised us all and had hired someone to do the wedding ceremony right then and there, at my parents house in the backyard. It was sneaky of her but ended up being such a blast. They had everyone they wanted to attend their wedding so they figured, why not just do it now!

My son was starting to have issues at school, so the school recommended that he be put on half a day.   With him on half a day, I was only able to student teach for half a day.  My college was okay with this, but I realized that I wasn't.  I was only going to be there until 10:40 and that wasn't long enough for me to learn what I wanted to learn.  It was such a hard decision.  Not only did I have to give up the student teaching, but I also had to drop out of my college. I never imagined that I would be a college drop out. Even for a semester. I was so excited to get into graduate school!  To top it all off - since I had to drop out of college they are making me pay 10% of my bill.   This is a couple of hundred dollars, which I don't have!  I will have to pay this back before I am able to apply to go back in January.  This is also still up in the air because we aren't even sure if my son will be able to go back to full time in January.   This whole situation has really been weighing heavy on my heart.  I have stayed home for so long with my children, and I was so excited to finally get out there and find myself.  I wanted to find my future career and finally start it.

Seeing the reason why you gave something up flourishing does make it much easier.  I am planning on doing other things while I wait to get back to school.

Then she broke the news that the arm was broken, and that she would have to manually set it back into place.  And she did not sugar coat that the whole experience was really going to hurt.  So I braced myself as best I could, and was so thankful that my toddler was not paying attention to anything that she said.  She set his arm, and he did indeed cry about it, but then they bandaged his arm with a colorful splint and he was all smiles again.

536,"The most memorable event in my life in the past 6 months has been when I ""ran away"" and tried to just live life on my own. I had recently been fired from my job, which was extremely depressing to me, and I fell into a depressed and low-energy state. I had been living with my mother for the last 6 months, and after being fired, I told my mother I'd be moving out at the end of the month due to my new bad habits, mainly involving drinking.  On the first of March, I drove my truck away from my mother's house, not to return for over 7 weeks. At first, I felt liberated - I knew I was homeless, but I had the freedom to do what I want, and didn't have anyone telling me what to do. I spent the first few weeks simply living in my truck, communicating with friends on the phone and generally just living a hedonic, isolated lifestyle. Eventually, I found it hard to even start taking care of my own basic needs (finding a bathroom, a safe place to park at night, etc.) and drove to a motel. Life living at the motel felt great - I finally had a warm bed to sleep in, a place where I felt safe - and each morning when I got up, I would rent one more night. I ended up staying at this motel for about 3 weeks. Unfortunately, I started this adventure with $3000, and by the time early April rolled around, I found I had less than $300 left in my bank account. At this point, I drove even further away from the city, to a Wal-Mart. I spent a few days and nights there, doing the same things - charging up my phone at the local starbucks, drinking, etc. To me, I felt like I was running out of time, and didn't know what to do. I was getting sick nearly every day. Finally, I realized I needed help. I tried to drive back in to town to check myself into a hospital, but halfway there, I was pulled over by a state patrol officer. I was handcuffed for driving under the influence.

One of my distant cousins had had plaques made for all the siblings, using old wood from the corn crib with the family name. They shared stories about their brother who had just died, and we met his illegitimate grandchildren whom we had just learned about. That was exciting, and everyone was so welcoming to them. They had inherited a portion of the estate from my great uncle on his death and had come to see the farm for the first and last time. At the sale, a young family with children made the highest bid. We were all happy to see that a new family with kids would be making new memories there. But we were all a bit broken-hearted to say goodbye to it as well. I took a lot of photographs and went to some of my favorite spots, like the creek in the woods, and the hayloft.

But at least I can say he went into peace. It had been a long, slow slide down, with his claws dug into the side of the cliff, and he may have thought he was climbing some of the time. Since losing the use of his legs some twenty years ago, his life had become a daily struggle to perform even the simplest of tasks. The life that had become drudgery, with us, his daughters, the only bright spot, he'd somehow still wanted to keep. He'd dug his teeth in like a stray dog into a scrap of bone. Then, he had a heart attack while going into an MRI machine. He was dead for twelve minutes. But God sent him back from Hell, and not only that, but woke him up. That doesn't happen after twelve minutes. He was able to talk and respond to questions. Perhaps dying had killed the stubborn part of him. He was able to accept the peace of God, speak to his daughters for a whole week, and say goodbye. And then he pried his fingers off the side of the cliff so suddenly that I was the only one there to observe his fall.",True,True,True,B,True

He took me to the Japanese Tea Garden, which is a place I had wanted to see for quite some time. We spent about an hour walking around the garden and just seeing the sights, and he seemed a little nervous the entire time. Honestly I just thought maybe he was still a little tied from the flight.

Everyone there already knew it was about to happen, he had called over 2 months ago to make sure everything was ready and that he was going to be able to pull it off.

The vet knew this could happen any time, so all we had to do was call, and we got in right away.

We held him as the vet administered the meds, and he was looking at my husband when his eyes closed. It's good that the image he took with him to Rainbow Bridge was his beloved daddy, his everything. I had my hand on his chest and I felt his heart stop. I don't even know how to process this, other than the crushing grief. I'm not a dog owner anymore, after 11 years. No more meds or pain, that's good. He's well and whole again, playing with my dad's dog at Rainbow Bridge as he waits for us. But here, no more walks, no more playing with his rope toy or watching him lie in the back yard with his head up toward the sun. no more checking on him every hour, no more dog to check on us.

But let me tell you, when I get to walk into my new home, and see all the great things about it now it just puts a smile on my face and it somehow makes it all worth it. One of the most memorable moments of the whole process came on a sunny, Sunday afternoon a few months back. We came across this great house online that truly fit all of our needs. It seemed like it was just too good to be true, a house that checked all our boxes and within our budget was just too good to be true. We contacted our realtor right away and said we need to see this house now! She warned us not to get too ahead of ourselves as the house had been on the market for a more than a couple of weeks and surely had many offers waiting to be approved. Regardless we wanted to go see it. As we drove up to the house it was even more perfect than the pictures could show, the street, the colors, the neighbors, and trees surrounding it were all perfect! We saw cars in the driveway and figured it was just other potential buyers but as we walked in we were greeted with an elderly couple walking out of the house. They introduced themselves and said they were on their way out and told us to enjoy the house. My wife and I said they did not have to rush out and could even stay if they wanted. This turned out to be the best decision! They walked us through the house and showed us every little corner and what made it all so special. They showed such detail and we did the same when explaining why this house was so perfect for us. We connected on a different level and as we left the house we told them we'd be making an offer the next day. It was going just like we imagined until our realtor called us and told us our offer was the fifth highest of all offers received. She mentioned the buyers were reviewing them all but again, not for us to get our hopes up as we were down there as far as offers went. Not 10 minutes went by when my phone rings again, this time an unknown number. I answer and to my pleasant surprise on the other end was the elderly woman we met at the beautiful house the day before. She had a sound of joy on her voice and explained she wanted to be the one to give me the good news. She went on to tell me that they were so happy to be accepting their offer.

We lived in a small town where we used to work far from home. He was one of my friends cousin.           As my friends family was my family's family friend.           I was working five days a week and go to Aunts house in the weekend. And it was a long routine of about an year.

577,"A month ago today, I received some extremely great news. My best friend's father found out his cancer was in remission after a long several year battle with a horrible cancer known as Glioblastoma. I was overjoyed, as this family has been almost like a second family to me and have seen me through the good times and bad. His father even offered me a place to stay when things were looking rough at my home life. When I had first heard the news of his cancer announcement I was in a tough emotional state as the chances of surviving this cancer can be low and the surgery that has to be performed on the brain is long and difficult. I just remember seeing him post surgery, post chemo and everything and just not seeing the man I grew up knowing. He lost most motor abilities and the ability to speak. The recovery took 3 years and still to this day he is just gaining back the ability to speak coherent partial sentences, enough for us to understand him. Now with the cancer in remission I feel relief, joy, and some angst as the doctors say the woods are still yet to be cleared but for now everything seems to be moving along well. Part of me knew he would be tough enough to fight through this as he is already capable of driving on his own, which came to much shock to the doctors as that is a rare recovery component so early into rehab. This is part of the reason why I have hope for his recovery because this man battled adversity his whole life to become who he is today and to lose all of that in a matter of weeks was certainly heartbreaking. As I reflect on this recovery I am constantly overfilled with emotions as I keep rethinking the situation over in my head. I feel I am being pulled in every direction as I am unsure how to entirely handle the recent news of the remission. My friend seems to be feeling the same as me and I try to show my emotions on my sleeve in front of him and provide needed solace. All we can do is wait and hope the cancer continues to diminish as the odds of this case of cancer reappearing are still high. I have high hopes that within the next year or two I will be celebrating with him as he continues to live his life to the fullest and now be brought down by this disease.",True,True,True,B,True

The most distressing was my diagnosis of congestive heart failure. My heart was not functioning problem because of the huge amount of weight that I was carrying.

Because of the blood thinners, weight loss surgery was risky and not recommended. To top things off, I had a sluggish thyroid which meant that my metabolism was not working effectively either, making weight loss almost impossible. My only option was to hold on to my faith in God and push past the barriers before me. The first thing that I did was change my eating habits. I chose a complete lifestyle change, one that I could live with for the rest of my life. I avoided high carb foods and sugary sweets and instead ate plenty of fruit and vegetables. I did internet research looking for healthy choices that would help me achieve my goals. I chose low carbs as opposed to no carbs because I knew this was a lifestyle change.

Yesterday was such a blur, despite the labor process only lasting a few hours. We are so excited to spend time with Danielle and watch her grow up.

598,"Sarah got the job in Amsterdam. She's really excited, and I'm happy for her, but I'm worried too. I know the doctors say her tumor is not aggressive, and that her situation is good, but it's still cancer. Amsterdam has excellent health care options, but her doctors here are very good and know her case. She says it's not a big deal and that she'll still be doing a lot of her tests when she flies back here, but still. The insurance situation is complicated, too. She says her company deals with this sort of thing all the time, and that they know what to do, but there's a difference between someone who's insurance is just in case and her situation. She can't afford any lapses or mistakes, and I'm not convinced everything will work out as smoothly as she thinks. Still, she's incredibly excited, and this does seem like a great opportunity for her. It's not my place to tell her what she can and can't do, so all I can do is be supportive and try to make sure she's doing everything she can to stay healthy. Not that she needs much help, she's been incredibly motivated not to let this thing stop her. That's probably part of why she's so all-in about this job. At least, for the first time in her life, she's moving and I don't have to help. Her company is taking care of everything, and except for one chair that I grudgingly agreed to store for her I don't have to lift a finger. She may or may not get the chair back. I hope I look back on this entry and see it as the start of good things and me being too protective. I'm still worried, though.",False,False,True,B,False

Everyone was laughing and having a great time, and I too was enjoying having a swim in the pool. I found myself at the deep end of the pool, and I had always been a little bit fearful of swimming over my head. There was no one else at the end of this pool and I was caught in my own world when I felt a hand brush against my thigh. I jerked away and my heart raced. At first I though something in the water had bit me. Or maybe it had just been a pool toy. But then I looked up and saw old and disgusting Larry with this sick grin on his face and his hand still near my thighs. I gasped and kicked away, ignoring my fear of deep water and swam as fast as I could. When I kicked away, I got some satisfaction when I felt my left foot slam into the side of Scary Larry's head.

I had the following week off for Christmas and planned to stay with my family. When I left from work that night, it was almost 8 p.m. and was already dark. My parents live in a secluded area which is pretty dark with a lot of forest around them. It's very beautiful during the day, but reminds me of something out of a horror movie at night. I had my high beams on most of the way since there aren't many cars on the road out there, especially late at night. And since the roads aren't very well lit the high beams help. I was also pretty tired since I left work late that night and wanted to be extra safe. Unfortunately it wasn't safe enough as I hit a deer that night and ran into a ditch. I'm not sure where the deer came from, well actually it probably came from the forests surrounding the roadway. But I never saw it coming. I hit the deer straight on and it smashed my windshield before I flew into the ditch. I remember seeing blood on my windshield before I ran into the ditch, I thought it was mine for the split second that I was still in control of my car. My car was totaled, but I was okay. I had some bruises and was in some pain, but didn't break anything. Fortunately all of this happened not too far from my parent's home so I called them and they were able to call the police and come with them pretty quickly. Since the accident, and my near death experience, I've had a different outlook on life. I've made a career change and I've decided to move closer to my family. Not because I'm afraid of driving long distances at night, but because I've realized life is too short and I want to spend it with my family and doing something I love.

I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.

Our parents have also been pressuring us to get married, so it was nice to see how happy they were to hear the wonderful news as well. I can't wait to marry him.

675,"I am a type 2 diabetic. When I went in to see my doctor in June she decided that my A1c was not low enough even though it was in the low 7s which I thought was great. My doctor said it should really be around 6 because higher A1c's lead to more problems down the road for diabetics. I take something besides insulin to help regulate diabetes. it's called Metfornin.  Metfornin is very typical and it's commonly used for diabetic patients to help regulate blood sugars. I have been taking Metfornin for 14 years since I had been determined to be a diabetic. The doctor increased my dosage of this drug to 3 daily instead of 2 which I did not think was a very big deal, I mean I had taken them for years with absolutely no problems.  I started getting sick, I thought it was taking blood pressure medicine.  I had ran out of blood pressure medicine about 2 weeks before I went to see my doctor. After I started taking the additional Metfornin I also started taking my blood pressure medicine and started having side effects like nausea and dizziness. I thought I had contracted the flu or blamed it on the blood pressure medicine. I was horribly ill and passed out after waking up on the 4th. I woke up in the hospital on July 4th.

The children enjoyed them self, playing with cousin they and Aunts and Uncles that just met or haven't seen in a long time.    My great-great-great grandfather was an Indian Chief.  We learn that we belong to the Cherokee Indians.  My family is mixed with Spanish, and French.   We listen to stories told my the elders about events that had happen in their days.

677,"Approximately 3 weeks ago, I got the best news I've received in a long time at work. I was notified by my boss that we exceeded our sales goals for the year. I think the most noteworthy thing about this is that my team is the youngest team the company has ever had. I think our average age is only 22 years old!  I knew something was happening when my boss asked me to come into his office. Once I got in there he had a big smurk on his face, so I knew then it must be good.

I drove us over to Disney World, and we set out on our adventure.  First we went on Space Mountain - I think Billy screamed more than I did.  We went on Big Thunder Railroad, and laughed like kids the entire time.  We went over to Epcot for a food tour - we both liked the Japananese food, and the beers in the Germany area.  We reminisced about the old times growing up, and our parents.  Billy shared with me that he still wasn't ready to settle down, but did have a girlfriend in London who sounded lovely.  We watched a parade, hugged Mickey Mouse, and even saw the fireworks show in the evening.  At the end of our day we drove home, and talked about making this an annual adventure for the two of us.

I worked on my resume and case for weeks on end to ensure i had the best chance of getting the position. i got into a few spats with coworkers about who should be promoted as well. this caused a lot of tension among us and made actual work tough for nearly a month. we had a first wave of interviews that knocked out half of the applicants. this made things even worse as some longer tenured employees were not pushed through to the second round of interviews. i was lucky enough to be pushed through myself. after the second round, we had two days where we did not know who had won the position. this was also stressful for us and put more tension on the office and all of us personally, as it was a life changing event for anyone who won the spot due to the salary and our life trajectories. after a few days, my manager called me into his office and informed me that i had won the position. this was a surprise to me as i thought other members were favored over me and would get the position. i was ecstatic to win the spot, as my salary more than doubled and i got great benefits. despite the stresses i was very happy with the situation.",True,True,True,B,True

When I left work, I decided to alleviate some stress by stopping at a little bar. I figured I'd have a couple of drinks and some food, and take my mind off things a little bit. After being seated for just a couple of minutes, the bartender came over. This drink is from the guy at the end, she said.

687,"We hadn't seen my daughter's father for several years. He had become recluse and didn't really have much to do with his children anymore. His mother had frequently told me that she was afraid he might take his own life, so while we had this idea hanging in the back of our minds, nothing can really prepare you for when it actually happens. I knew when I received the call from her last week that it wasn't good news. She was crying and could hardly get the words out that our daughter's dad was gone. I think what made this so incredibly difficult for my daughter was that she never got to say goodbye. Her last words were so long ago that she really couldn't recall them. Try as she might, she couldn't bring to mind pleasant or happy memories of him. It really has made her think about how he decided to leave. He has made her realize that the only way she could get over it is to forgive him and find a new path in life that invokes strength and love. His passing in life, sadly, has affected us more than his life ever did. We always tried to anticipate a day when he would show up.

688,"My dad got remarried. It came as a sudden surprise as he had not told us anything about it and so me and my younger brother were shocked. The emotional wounds of losing our mother 2 years prior were still fresh and the pain had yet to fade. So when he invited us out to dinner and brought along a lady-friend, we were surprised to say the least when he announced to us that this was his fiance and that they were to be wed in a few days. Our dad was never really close to us growing up so communication was always a little awkward. We respected him and he respected us, but he was never much of a ""father"". Instead it was our mom that kept us on track, fed us, drove us to all our activities, and was there when we needed someone to talk to. I guess this is typical of an Asian family, stereotype or not. But still, he mourned just as much as me or my brother when it came to the loss of our mom and I had felt our familial ties pull taught as now we were down to just the three of us. At that time I was just graduating college and my brother was transferring between universities, so none of us were prepared to lose someone so important so early on. It felt like our lives were just beginning and we imagined our mom to be there every step of the way, to introducing our future girlfriends to eventually seeing our mom hold our future kids with the same love that they had blessed our childhood with. All of that was gone now. So him announcing his new marriage just 2 years later felt so fast and abrupt to me. I felt like we barely had any time to process my mom's death, and now I suddenly had to face another big shift in our family. Maybe it partly had to due with my dad's lack of communication, but that fault also laid with me as I had not really attempted to make any headway in understanding each other either. So I guess in hindsight it's understandable, why he chose to wait until the very last minute to announce a new family member. It didn't feel like a replacement of our mom. It just felt like a new companion for our dad, someone to keep him busy and help him move on. I still don't even refer to her as ""mom"" but as ""auntie"" and she seems to be very understanding of such. After all, how can you replace someone that loved you for 25 years of your life.

We were living with her father at the time which was a very uncomfortable situation for the both of us. While I slaved away jumping from dead end job to dead end job, she continued to do nothing to help us. Even bringing up the idea of going job hunting was enough to ensue a shouting match, a crying fit, ecetera. Eventually I just stopped trying.

709,We had a family reunion about 4 months ago that was a really great time. I got to see my distant family that I hadn't seen in decades since I was a kid and close ones that I rarely see. It was cool to see my grandpa because It's honestly been at least 25 years and since he is handicap it's hard for him to get around. He also lives on the opposite coast so it is just hard to meet up. He was looking in pretty good health about the same as when he left so that was good to see considering all the time that has passed. My grandma was there too I had my issues in the past with her but it was still nice to see her. She treated my mom poorly so we don't talk much but I put aside my issues just for this small time period to make the gathering go smooth. I got to see my favorite aunt and uncle who both shared similar passions to me with computers and tech stuff and it's been like 20 years since I saw them so that was sweet. Basically they are the same as I remember just older but they are just as into tech stuff as they were back then. I remember I would bring my GameBoy or old PC games over to their house and they would know about them or have them themselves. Just really good memories honesty that I was happy to remember with how stressful life has been. Finally I got to just catch up with some other family members like my cousins and some others who I didn't remember as well cause I was so young back then. This might have been the last time a lot of us get to meet because we all live so far apart and aren't exactly wealthy so we tried to make the most of it. We took a lot of pictures and overall had a great time and we pledged to try and talk over the phone/webcam more often.

710,"My house burned down in April. I was in my bedroom when I heard a loud popping noise at about 4 in the morning. I jumped out of bed and ran into the living room to see what the noise was, and, seeing nothing, returned to my bedroom to discover that the noise had been something exploding next to my bed and my room was on fire. Both my laptop and phone were plugged in next to my bed, and it's unclear which one overheated and caused the fire, but by the time I noticed the fire had started there was no time to put it out. I woke up my family and we grabbed our pets and ran outside. We called the fire department, but our house is located in the middle of the woods in a very rural area, so it took them an hour to find us. We actually walked to the end of the end of the driveway and tried to flag them down as they drove up and down the road looking for our address, but it took them a while to see us. When they finally got back to our house, most of it had burned. My room, my brothers room, the hallway, the kitchen, my mom's room, the living room, and the bathroom were mostly destroyed. The parts of the house that hadn't burned were destroyed by water damage from putting the fire out. Everyone else in my family was able to sift through the rubble the next day to find that, although their walls, floors, and clothes were ruined, a lot of their possessions remained in tact. Because the fire had started in my room, however, every single thing I owned was burned to ash. This was an emotional, frightening, and stressful event",True,True,True,B,True

Meaning, if you accidentally get pregnant, or were assaulted which resulted in you becoming pregnant, there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting an abortion. I don't believe a baby is alive until it is nearly out of the womb, and I'm talking days before. I'd like to meet one person who remembers their time in their mother's belly.

714,"A couple of months ago in May I took my 6 year old son fishing for the first time in his life. We woke up very early in the morning eating breakfast and brushing out teeth. After doing this we loaded up the car with our fishing gear and prepared to get out on the road. We drove for almost an hour until we arrived safely at our destination. We ended up going to the Clearwater Pier in Clearwater, FL. Clearwater pier is a huge bridge which used to connect Clearwater to St. Pete but was shut down and later re-purposed into a fishing pier. The morning started out by me teaching him a few safety precautions and showing him how to tie his lines and properly setup his fishing poles. We then began to proceed to fish, the morning started out slow but eventually we began catching fish. The first fish he managed to catch was a small Jack Crevalle. I was so proud of him in this moment no words can describe how it felt watching my son catch his first fish and being able to help him do this.  We kept fishing until lunch time catching a few fish in between. At lunch we prepared a pick-nick with the food supplies we had brought. Once we finished eating lunch we began fishing again catching multiple more fish each until we decided we had fished long enough. We packed up our gear which took around 20-30 minutes and got in the car. After getting in the car we decided to stop on the way home for hamburgers and ice cream. Once we arrived home we cleaned our fishing equipment properly and went inside to shower and relax.",True,True,True,B,True

We went out on our boat and spent the day at the beach and island near our home, enjoying the sun and doing a lot of fishing. At night we went to a local seafood restaurant, and had a great time drinking and listening to music. When we were done with that, we took the kids to the local playground. We played tennis and then played a game of flag football. The last day they were with us, we went out on the boat again. It was really hot - summer in Florida is like that - and the kids wanted to go the the ""sand bar"", a place that boats gather at low tide. There were probably about 100 boats out there that day. Everyone is having a great time, partying and swimming and playing music and just having a great time. The kids were doing dives off of the boat, and then we played football in the water with other people. We sat out on floats and talked about family and old times. It was so fun, hot and relaxing. We had lunch on the boat and the kids continues to swim and play. They really had a lot of fun and are now thinking of buying a boat and keeping it at our house, so they can come down whenever they want and get on the water.

716,"Just a few weeks ago in early August, my great Aunt had her 100th birthday!  My close and immediate family is relatively small compared to most people.  I only have  two pairs of aunts and uncles with 6 total cousins (although 3 of them are married), and 5 little nieces/nephews who are all under 8 years old that I see on a regular basis, even on holidays.  My father's side of the family is not in our lives, so gatherings are usually small and more personal and intimate.  So in other words, it's a tight knit family and my great Aunt is basically the ""matriarch"" of the family. The event was a simple party where we rented out a room for everyone in a nice Italian restaurant.  Almost everyone was there with the exception of my brother who was working and my cousin and his wife and kids who are currently living in DC.  There was also a few close family friends like my late Uncle's boyfriend as well to celebrate with us. What made the event/party so special and memorable is not just that my Aunt is now 100, it's how in relatively good health she still is in!  Aside from not being able to drive anymore, she is still able to live on her own and take care of herself without needing any sort of assisted living.  She is still as sharp as ever mentally and is probably the most wholesome and nicest person that I have ever met!  One of the things that she did was dig up some really old photos of everyone from when they were kids and passed them around after dinner.  Even though I looked goofy younger, it was still a really touching moment because she had photos of everyone there from when they were kids.  She really has been through and seen a lot and it's incredible that she is still going strong.

Brian lives a few cities over so we don't see him often, but he gathered all of our best friends from high school for a huge BBQ. There wasn't a chance in the world that we would miss it. Not only that but unbeknownst to us, they all pitched in for a massive 3-foot surprise birthday cake for us. It had military action figures on all sides, and was both chocolate and vanilla flavors at different levels. I even saw oreos and peanut butter cups on there, which are my two favorite snacks. Lately we have been talking on the phone a lot about me being deployed, so it was touching to receive such a big cake. I know Brian's brother served multiple tours a while back, so he understands what it means when a deployment is looming. Aside from the crazy cake, we had tons of food on his new industrial sized grill. He bought three types of burgers, tons of brats, hot dogs, and all the vegan options available. In addition we had at least a half dozen large coolers filled beer and water. As we chatted with old friends long into the night, I couldn't help but remember how great some of the times we used to have were. It would be a shame if our friends didn't get together like this after all we've been through, and it's especially important that we are all able to make time for the group.

About six months ago my family of seven did the unthinkable: we moved more than 1,000 miles north to an area we didn't know much about. My dad took a very good job in a new area, and it made the most sense for our big family financially for him to accept. Even though that meant going to new schools and losing friends for my siblings and I, we knew our family needed our dad to take this job. The move itself was pretty crazy, since we needed five large moving trucks to haul our things. We had one truck that was nothing more than our beds and bed frames. Another truck seemingly held all of our clothes, which was very eye opening. We have a lot of clothes! After finally getting settled in however, we really began to love our new surroundings. Moving from the city to a more rural area was perfect for my brothers and sisters and I. We finally had room to play sports and do all sorts of activities outside. Growing up in a downtown situation made it hard for us to experience this type of freedom, and we relished in it right away.

At the same time I saw a few nurses and doctors running into my room and yelling ""baby's heartbeat dropped"". I got really stressed out and I could not believe what was happening. It was very much unexpected. They got me to relax my body on my hands and knees and they gave me several shots. But still they could not get the baby to get back to normal. They they decided they have to do a c-section on me and get the baby out right away. Next they took me to the operating room. All I saw was so many heads staring at me and acting stressed out. In the operating room they gave me the anesthetic shots to my back without even numbing the area. It was severely painful like electric currents running down my leg. They they inserted a tube into my genitals and gave me more shots on my arm. At this point I was losing hope of seeing my baby boy alive. I felt so helpless and scared. Tears ran down my cheeks. All of sudden they they yelled ""Looks like he's picking up"" and I was much relieved. I just felt like I woke up from a horrible dream. Everybody was so relieved and happy that he was recovered without having to do a c-section delivery. When they took me back to the room I saw my husband was crying. I just gave him a long hug and said ""God bless him!.",True,True,True,B,True

He may never have friends. He may never move out on his own . My precious boy who is always happy and so very loving will now be looked at as a freak in society.  All because of a diagnosis. Because of a disability in being social. Its enough to make my head spin. With all the new realizations comes some very real emotions. Depression seemed to take roots and flourish within me .  Then a conversation with my husband helped me shed the diagnosis like a skin. He said,""What has changed?  A diagnosis? That's it. He is still your baby boy, still your son. He still loves you  just the same . And I can bet that you love him just the same if not more now. "" That is a conversation I will replay in my mind forever.

Boys are in one vehicle, girls are in the other.  We take our time on the drive because tonight will just be s'mores and a bonfire.  We finally make it to our campground around 3:00pm.  We unpack the vehicles and trailer so we can get the two tents up before dark.  After an hour, we have the tents up and have started setting up chairs, fire pit, coolers, food, and horseshoes.  Around 6pm, we start cooking hotdogs and just hang out for the night.  We know that we will have to be up by 9am to get ready for the river.

I had worked hard for what was about to happen and I had sacrificed much of my family life to reach this goal. Today was the day that I would receive my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. This had been a goal since I graduated with my Bachelors degree almost 25 years earlier. Due to starting a family shortly after receiving my Bachelors degree, I had put off getting my Masters until my life had settled and I was financially capable of achieving this goal. Well, that time came 2 years ago when I took the step of enrolling in school at the age of 46. Did I need the Masters degree? Would it change my life? Would it allow me to make more money and be more successful? Well, yes I did need the degree and yes it would change my life. I mainly did it to keep a promise that I made to my parents when I had started my Family. It had been 25 years since I made that promise to them and now they wouldn't be here to witness it. So many emotions ran through my mind. Should I have done it earlier so that my parents could have been here? I knew that they were looking down upon me and this day and were just as proud as they would have been if they were here to see it with their own eyes. What made this even more special is that I would receive my Degree alongside of my Daughter who on the exact day, was receiving her Masters degree in Chemical Engineering. She has always been proud of here Dad but I know that she was more excited about my graduation than hers. When my name was called, I stood up, walked up onto that stage and broke down in tears. I don't know what caused the sudden surge of emotions but part of me felt my parents right there on the stage with me. I imagined my Mom crying and my Dad holding back tears of Joy.

She said she was very single and living with her son in Daytona Beach Florida and invited me down (I lived in a suburb of Cleveland Ohio at the time.)      I planned to visit her, as I was nearing the end of my operations, and pretty sick of Northern winter weather. So, I visited this woman I had not seen in 48 years in April of this year. I was shocked that she wanted to see me the entire time I was there, but dismayed I didn't get our second kiss. I found and find her very attractive still.

Thus, I took a big chance and decided to move down.     I found a home in June of 2019, that sounded great! It was furnished and the cost was affordable, thus I decided on it, and began to throw away all my furniture and everthing else from my long past.     When I finally moved down in late July of 2019, I got here and found that I was a victim of an internet scam by the woman selling me a place to live. There was no house. I had to live in a Motel 6 and an Airbnb until I could borrow money from my sister to find a home. The move itself now cost me $2000 and I have no furniture, forks, knives, dishes, pots, pans.....well I had nothing to put into it.

765,"Last month I made a breakthrough on one of my projects at work. I've been trying to grow sugar maples in tissue culture for three years and have not had much success. In May, I was able to get three times the number of plants to survive than I've had in the last two years. These plants that have survived have continued to survive and I've been able to experiment on them with different media components and hormone concentrations to get some of these plants to root. The plants need to have roots to really thrive and without them, they can't live for very long. Last month I was able to find a hormone concentration that is starting to stimulate root production. This is very exciting and gives me a lot of satisfaction because there wasn't much information in the published literature to use as a guide. I had to take information from different plant species and come up with my own concentrations and trials. In science, we have a lot of frustration. We have to constantly repeat experiments and come up with new ideas. It's fun and challenging but it also comes with stress and frustration. We have a grant for this work, so it's been tough to have this project not work well. If we need to reapply for additional funding, it would be tough to justify it for a project that's not working. The maple trees I'm working with are higher sugar producing tress that are valuable for maple sugar growers as they get better syrup from the sap of those trees. With increasing insect pests that destroy these trees, it's important to have a tissue culture source of the trees. I really enjoy when I can get a project to work.

They liked to put on a facade that they cared about me, but their actions always told a different story. They were both heavily into drug abuse for as long as I can remember. Always thinking they're keeping me in the shadows of their activities and discussions. They're trying to ""protect"" me from that world and that life they were leading they'd tell me. ""Why should I care? We've never been close."" I'd tell that lie to myself almost every day to try to push down the feelings of love that were still buried somewhere deep down. Over the years it's always been the same story. I try to help them both in any way I can. I would preach for hours and give them advice on how to move forward and break out of the kind of life they were in. I'd set them up for success just to see them fall back into the same routine they've always had. They never wanted to get better. I see that now. ""We're family after all. We have to look after each other no matter what."" The event that ended my abusive relationship is when I gave them a place to stay when they had nowhere else to go and they ended up stealing from me. That day just broke me. After everything I've done for them over the years how could they do that? I saw clearly for the first time. This isn't what family is.

Thank god I saved myself that hassle! However, once I had everything set up, was feeling proud and ready to put up the lights. I realized much to my dismay that the ladder I had was not tall enough.

The water was clear, the sand was white, and it was very hot. I enjoyed myself quite a bit. The most memorable part of the vacation was touring through the island, and seeing so many historic monuments, and places. We took a lot of pictures, and appreciated our time together while on vacation. We attended a few parties, that the locals were having at their place of residence, and also had quite a few drinks.

792,"This past summer, I guess it was July, I got a call from my only child. This was a little unusual because they rarely called me. Our conversations were usually tense and extremely upsetting so I had slowly gotten used to the loneliness of not hearing from them. Anyway, it seems they were breaking up with their current romantic partner and they were very devastated. They told me that they had no friends and I was the only person that they could call. My heart ached for them but there was virtually nothing that I could do for them except listen. Eventually things got ironed out a little and it seemed like they were on a good path. We talked several times a week. Then the phone calls stopped again and I started to fear that they had gone back to their ex. I had found out that the ex supposedly hated me and did not allow my child to call me or answer the phone if I called them. After about ten days I did get in touch with them and yes they had gone to see their ex. Then they told me they were quitting their job and moving across the country to live with their ex and the ex's parents until they could find work. The last time I spoke to them was about three weeks ago when they were packing. Again, we had a very tense short conversation and then that was it. So, I googled what was going on between us and I found this thing called 'parent abandonment'. Just reading the words was like a punch in the gut. How could this be happening? Apparently it's something of a trend with the younger crowd. I read a few articles about it and then I decided I knew all I ever wanted to know about this.

797,"About five months ago I decided to go to a psychologist. I wasn't really having any problems. I just thought it would be interesting to talk to a professional about some things I've wondered about during my lifetime. Money and time were not restricting me from going, and I knew if I didn't like it after the first visit I could just stop going. But as it turned out, I really liked the therapist and enjoyed talking to her. So I went back week after week and looked forward to it. We talked about all kinds of things, but the main issue I wanted to address was why I was never interested in having a boyfriend. In high school my friends always were excited about dating. Sometimes they would be ecstatically happy about their boyfriend and another time they would be terribly depressed about a break-up. At parties you would see couples pairing off and making out. Many times 'he kissed me' would be the main topic of conversation with my friends. But I never quite understood what the attraction was. I didn't have any desire for a boyfriend. I didn't even think sex sounded interesting or desirable. And still, to this day, I have not been interested in dating. I enjoy people. I love people. But I don't have an interest in finding 'love' like you see in the movies. Well, I was surprised and, I guess, even relieved when the therapist diagnosed me as 'asexual'. Maybe I shouldn't describe it as a diagnosis because it's not a disease. There is not anything 'wrong' with me. In fact, I'm kind of glad to be asexual.

I went to school because I had to, and they were there because they had to be. It wasn't a big deal...I talked to them, because I didn't have a choice. Sure I was bullied, and I had a hell of a time...but that little bit of socialization helped me in may ways. Once I graduated, I didn't feel the need to really go out. And that snowballed in the last decade to me possibly being a hermit. I wouldn't call myself that, but my sister did a couple weeks ago when she called to catch up.  I'm not going to lie, it hurt because I knew it was true. I had only moved here a few months ago, I told her...but she laughed. She knew that was an excuse. This was ongoing behavior for me, and we both knew it. So I took the plunge the next day, joined a local writer's club and opened up. A few of us exchanged social media info, and started chatting on the phone and thru text. We all kinda clicked. Big Sis wasn't all that impressed...apparently people are supposed to do these sort of things. Anywho, just writing to brag a little about finally coming out of my shell after so long of being a hermit. Sorry I haven't written lately...I've been busy with the new friends!

The next morning they sent a message apologizing for their behavior. I took some time to take care of myself and accepted her apology a few hours later. Our conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. What ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. In the end she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse.

829,"I still think about the mugging. It's been over a month now yet it is still just as upsetting now as it was then. Every time I'm on the subway I find myself looking around constantly, scanning everyone else up and down. I'm even thinking about what I should do if someone starts approaching me, where can I run to, where is the nearest exit, or is there anything I can just hide behind. Every now and then I see someone who looks like the mugger. It startles me every time. Even if its in broad daylight or in some big store with dozens of other people in it. I know this is insane but I think he may be following me, maybe lying in wait to do it all over again. And this I really hate, I used to have no problem with chatting up people in public, no problem with making new friends, but now I try to avoid it all costs. I just walk around with a hoodie up and headphones in, hoping no one notices me or walks towards me or anything like that.  I'm pretty much running when in public just so some other mugger will have less of a chance to exploit me. I haven't worn what I was wearing that night again. Not even the shoes. I should probably just throw all that clothing away, even seeing it sitting in the corner of the room is too much. It just brings up those memories all over that run and run like a video stuck on repeat. I'm not sure if I should donate it to goodwill or something - I don't know why I find myself thinking like this, but it's almost like everything to do with that night is tainted. Why should I give something that's been ruined like that to someone in need? I'm actually thinking of moving out of the city now. If something like this happens again I just couldn't handle it. I can barely handle it now. Things weren't all that stressful before the mugging, but now I'm almost having panic attacks just putting on my coat and tying my shoes.

831,"This summer in July, we headed up to Idaho for my husband's family reunion. It is a reunion that takes place every year for his grandmother's siblings and their posterity. We drove up in our van with our four children. It is always a bit of an ordeal traveling with children, trying to keep them happy and fed and what not. There were some squabbles and other things, but we made the long drive with one stop over to visit my brother in Utah. When we arrived on the farm in Idaho, the kids scattered and we set up the tent. We were under a tree, hoping for a little shade in the the unusually warm weather. As the day wore on, our tent was surrounded by other tents as my husband's cousins arrived and set up their tents as well. We met and re-met many extended family members as our kids played and slid down the hill on a big black tarp wet with sprinklers. At dinner time, everyone gathered under a pavilion and talked and laughed. The next day, we all wore color-coordinated shirts and took a huge family picture. There was a different color for each of my husband's grandmother's siblings, and their posterity all wore that color--there were over 100 people. It was humbling and amazing to see the result of many years of labors of love from those parents and their children, their children, and their children.

859,"This past week I had an interesting out of the ordinary event that occurred. I was driving home and I noticed an old dog trying to cross the road. The dog was clearly old by the way it moved and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about it's safety so I jumped out and got a collar and leash and i had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. From there I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. Ok so where do I go from here I thought to myself as the dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the  street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning. Or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. I chose the latter so off we went in the dark following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend.

My wedding was held in india because my whole family is living there. All ceremonies were as per indian rituals. Mostly my all cousins were attended my wedding and it was a first wedding in my family after so many years. It was 4 days wedding ceremony. first day was called mehndi ceremony. The second day was haldi ceremony. Third day was a musical night and the last one is a wedding night. There were around 1000 people on my wedding night. My all near and dear perform dance for me.

To see him up there, in front of many of our friends and family, giving a speech on what it means to be an Eagle Scout and how the journey to Eagle had made him the person he is brought tears to my eyes. He was very confident in his speaking, yet you could hear the crack of emotion when he mentioned certain people. You could tell that not only did his accomplishment mean a lot to him. But so did all the people who helped him along the way. As I sat there listening to him, I could not help but to think of the entire journey. It started when he was 6 years old as a Cub Scout. I was reminded of how hard he worked and how many fun times we shared on campouts and doing other activities related to Scouting. And I was so happy to have had the opportunity to share such moments with him. I also though of how proud I am that he is my son and also my best friend. He makes me a better person everyday through his behavior and the things that he does. I could not have asked for a better kid and I am so happy he has grown into the man he has. At one point during the ceremony, I looked around at everyone else who was there. I could tell he'd had a similar effect on them as well. They were proud of him and how hard he'd worked. They were also proud to know and that was perhaps the most heartwarming thing of all. To see others crying and sharing in the joy of his accomplishments was pretty amazing. It's something all parents should experience. It's a validation of sorts, and parents needs that, I think. Parenting is such a hard thing.

866,"Okay, 3 weeks ago, something very meaningful and stressful and quite challenging happened in my life. Leah, my 4 year old, began pre-school. I was already a nervous wreck, because she and I had to get up early to go see my oldest daughter do her ""Senior Walk"", where all of the seniors walk into school on the first day behind their principal and all of us parents are on the sides cheering and yelling and crying and it is over in 5 minutes.  I was worried about Leah having to get up early and us driving to the high school, finding a parking spot and then getting back to her school and having her into her classroom on time. We had no problem getting back to her school in time. My plan was to park and walk my little girl to her class, but on the car ride over, she declared that she wanted to be dropped off and walk into the school by herself, because she was a big girl. I was sad. When we got to her school, and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs and they walked her into the building. I cried, I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence and sure of herself and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. She is my miracle baby and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been she and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house and I miss her. I miss having her eat lunch with me and I walked into the mall without her and felt like someone was going to ask me for id when I walked into the kids section of a store. I didn't get begged to go into Build a Bear or get a Frappucino from Starbucks and have to wait for her to jump on all of the squares in the tile flooring.

872,A memorable event that happened to me in the last few months was that I got a raise out of the blue in the past two weeks. I was given the raise because I had been accountable to two donors at the private school I work at. These donors reached out to administration to offer me a ten percent raise. I was not expecting this and was not only flattered but completely surprised. It made me feel proud of my accomplishment of reaching out to these donors to let them know where and how the money they donated to the library I manage was being spent. I plan on using the money to pay off a car loan I recently got. What I did to get the raise was to write monthly reports. In the reports I put what we spent the money on. I also put what student engagement was happening because of the monetary gift. Student engagement is very important to these donors. They liked hearing that students used their gift appropriately. They also liked seeing images of the students using items bought with the gift. At the end of the year I sent the donors a comprehensive report. In the report were statistics about student engagement. I also had photos in the report. The report also contained information on how we will be using the items bought with the donation.

From the airport we took a taxi to our hotel, which was right in the middle of the city. Immediately, I knew that I was in a special place. The people in France were so much more open and kind to me than I had ever expected. As an American, there is a pervasive stereotype that the French are all mean and rude and nasty. This couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the vast majority of Parisians that I interacted with were wonderful people. I found that as long as you are respectful towards them, they treat you with just as much respect back. Another thing I noticed about French people was that they are much more open to you if you try and speak a little French. I think that this shows them that you are trying to learn their culture, rather than forcing them to speak English. After our trip to France, we flew to Italy. My experience there was very similar to my experience in France. The people were wonderful and much more kind than I was expecting. On the whole, this experience changed my outlook on life.

874,"Four months ago I had to let go of my most beloved possession-my faithful, yellow, 1971 Chevy corvette. I had to sell it because I lost my job and I had to save my family home from foreclosure until things get better again. I dreamed about this car since I was a boy of seven while looking at car magazines with my school buddies.  One day I came home from school and told my mom and dad that some day this car would be mine. They just laughed at my naive childhood dreams, they were simple country ""folk"", living in rural Texas. My was father a strict military man, stationed at a Fort Hood army base, and certainly not interested in fast cars or any ""fancy"" things like that. He would say that such things were a ""foolish waste of time and money"" and that a man's job is not to own ""fancy"" things but to serve his family and put bacon and bread on the table. However, I  was a free spirit, quiet different from my parents and their ways. I followed my dream of the ""super car"" and purchased my corvette when I turned twenty-two with my own hard-earned money. I loved my car all these years, not as a fancy object that I would show off to others, but a symbol of my own hard work and dreams. It represented my character and ""together"" we went through some many memorable experiences in life.  It was a very tough and heartbreaking decision to sell it, however, I had to do it for my wife and my two children. Their well-being and comfortable is much more important to me than any sentimental object-even my ""super car"". I told myself that when things turned around again, I could always get another one. Cars can be easily replaced but a family happiness in once in a lifetime. My heart broke when I took it out of the garage for the last time and handed the keys to a young man who came to purchase it all the way from Salt Lake City, Utah, with his father. I looked at his face and saw his eyes shining with excitement. he reminded me of myself when I first got my car, a dreamed who reached his goal! I wished him good luck and I hope that he will enjoy it as much as I did all these years.

We had such a good time setting up her new house, buying furniture and unpacking.  It all seemed to be going well until she broke down in tears.  I was distraught as she sobbed that she didn't want to be there, that it was too far away from home. I tried (in vain) to be encouraging. I told her to think of it as a new adventure.  I held her as she wept, soothing that it was time for her to be on her own and that I knew she would be successful. I believed she had a heart for kids and that this was her vocation.  She SAID this was what she always wanted, but the reality of it was just too overwhelming.  To be honest, as much as I love my daughter, I don't get it.  I would have killed for such a great opportunity at her age.  She was being given what she said she wanted, and there she was a total wreck!

876,"I got Azul, our Blue headed macaw to step up today!  Azul was hatched back in February and I have been hand feeding him since March when he was pulled from his nest box.  Having to feed him every 2 hours was hard and stressful, but after today that stress and hard work finally payed off!  Now that he has been on solid food since May, we've been trying to start his training to fly, but in order to do that, we need him to willingly step out of his enclosure and onto our hands.  We've been letting him learn to fly by letting him out of his enclosure and to just hang out in our prep kitchen while we work on cutting up fruits and vegetables for the the other birds.  Azul has been allowed to do whatever he wanted since about the end of May, but now that it's July, it is time for him to start his formal training.  The first thing I had to teach him was how to step onto my hand for a piece of food.  It was a struggle at first because he always wanted to play with our hand instead of offering a foot.  So when we'd place our hand out he would instead try to bite it to elicit a response from us (usually we'd would scratch his head so he didn't know why my hand was in front of his foot.)   For the first week of July I would place my hand by his perch and say ""Step up"" and if he moved towards my hand or lifted his foot, I would give him a piece.  Then when he got good at that, I would do the same thing, however instead for him to move towards my hand to reward him, I waited until he was fully placing a foot on my hand before he got his treat.  This past week I have been working daily with him and he has been progressing little by little.  Just on Monday he though about lifting the other foot off the perch.  Unfortunately I had to skip his training these past few days due to how busy we have been so Azul hasn't gotten any practice for the past three days.  I was expecting when I got into work today and got ready to train him that Azul would be back as square one after having those few days off.  However, instead of regressing in his training he actually progressed with out me!  When I asked him to ""Step up"" he did the cutest little hop and landed, both feet on my hand.  I was so excited that I had to remember not to jump or I might scare Azul.  It was such a moment to be held. After months of us hand-raising him and Azul getting some independence from us for a month I didn't realize how exciting and emotion filled getting over the first hurtle of training would be for me.  To hatch this gut go from being an egg to a bird who came on cue was such a joyous moment that I realized what this job was going to be like.  Leading up to this point, everyday was stressful and felt overbearing.  But getting to help these birds learn what is is to be a part of our program made me realize how much fun and fulfilling working with these babies can be.

877,"In May I ran the science olympiad at school after months of organization. I was the only one working on it despite the fact that they added additional grade levels to the event. It had originally just been fifth and sixth grade, but this most recent year they added third and fourth grade in as well. This made it more challenging because being younger, they are obviously at a different stage of development than fifth and sixth graders. Organizing academic events, including engineering-related and computer science-related events that would work across all grade levels added to the challenge. Plus, I was organizing it all by myself. So I had to come up with the list of events, buy and organize all of the supplies, create and write all the directions, and organize all the teams across grade levels in a balanced fashion. The latter was probably the most challenging part because I don't know all of the grade levels, and so I don't know the kids very well, and their teachers weren't overly helpful at providing information about them. Regardless, we got to the day of, and I had been very stressed. I didn't think it would turn out well because of all the challenges and the high variety in grade level. At the last minute I found out that a local politician, a state congress person, had even been invited to the event, so I was extra stressed about that as well. However, it all ran much better than I expected. The kids all had a great time, the teachers were very supportive during the events themselves, and most importantly the older kids helped support the younger students in positive ways. Even though it was a competitive event, they made sure the younger students were included. The principals and superintendent were very happy with how it worked out, and it helped lead to me getting my original job back as primarily a science teacher rather than teaching math for the bulk of my instructional time. That made me happy most of all that going forward, I am going to be able to teach what I am most passionate about, and I was able to get that back on the basis of my hard work and efforts.",True,True,True,B,True

However, I worry about that not happening because they live in a different state now, so he doesn't get to spend a lot of time with me. It made me feel like we do have a really strong bond when he insisted on me doing his routine with him. I got to cuddle him while he drank some milk. Then, we went into his bedroom and read a couple of books. We cuddled some more while rocking in his rocking chair.

It was a painting of birds and watermelons. The brush strokes were detailed and smooth. The colors were muted but still seemed to pop out at you. The lines and definition were precise but also looked blended so that each object moved seamlessly into the other. i wanted to know who painted this. the plaque under the painting told me the name of the painting and the painter. I decided that I would look up more work by this artist. I wanted to learn from their style . I thought it would be great to paint like that.

We had had three storms in a row and I had all the plowing and roof shoveling I could handle. The money was good, but it was exhausting work. On Sunday, I could not wait to get home because my dog, Scarlet, was new to the family and I knew she needed some company. I got home and Scarlet was so happy to see me that she was quivering. I took her out so she could do her business and that didn't take long. I sense she is not fond of the cold and snow. We got back inside and I got her some food and fresh water while I heated up a bowl of homemade chili, I had leftover. I was cold inside and out and just wanted to relax. The night was perfect to get a nice hot fire going in the fireplace. I piled in some dry kindling and a few seasoned pieces of ash and the fire was crackling and burning beautifully. I got up to go fetch my chili and when I came back into the room, I saw that Scarlet was hiding behind the chair shaking with a fearful look on her face. I set my bowl down and got down close to her to comfort her. I am not sure of her first year and what she went through before I rescued her from the shelter. I have seen occasional things that seemed to trigger some anxiety, but not like this. I think it may have been the sound of the fire and the intense warmth in the beginning. I picked her up like a baby and held her in my arms and sat on the couch. She was a bit uneasy, at first, but talking to her and taking occasional bites from my bowl of chili, she seemed to calm down and she looked up at me, with a knowing look in her eyes and I felt her tail wagging ever so slightly. I rubbed her belly with one hand and finished my chili with the other hand. As soon as I put my spoon in the empty bowl, she jumped up and licked a bit of chili off my chin, I had dribbled, and then didn't stop there. She licked my face all over.

She wasn't even awake enough to realize she hadn't eaten since the night before. And by the time we got to the hospital, well there were things to see so that kept her distracted enough. We met up with the surgeon and went in the operating waiting room which is where things got iffy. First, Gabby realized this was a doctor's office, and she didn't like that. Doctors = shots. Then, they put her in the operating robe, which was cold. And then, she got bored with the few rattles and toys we brought. Eventually they took her for surgery and that's when she (and I!) broke down. She started screaming hysterically, and I couldn't stop myself from sobbing. She's just so tiny. Like, I know she in the 95th percentile for height within other one-year-olds but still that's tiny. Brandon took good care of me and we waited it out in the coffee shop.

There wasn't a lot of time for me to think as I was still groggy, so I quickly went back inside to grab a cup of coffee before heading out.

My blood pressure was 200-something over 108 in the ambulance and they said the EKG looked fine. At the hospital no one actually told me I had a heart attack. After about an hour or two sitting there I felt fine. A little winded, but otherwise no pain. They wanted me to stick around to MAYBE do a heart cath, but that would have been another two days in the hospital and as I said I was feeling fine. So I left.

It wasn't a big surprise to me as he was cross-dressing as a female since I'd known him, but I did not know that he actually saw himself as female.

Unfortunately, she decided to come out to her parents against my advice, even though we had talked about waiting until she was further along on hormones and maybe tell them during a joint counseling session, as they are very conservative and against everything LGTB+ related.  They did not take it well and things have been really rocky.  Her mom is passive-aggressive and she decided randomly to unfriend us both from Facebook and not to attend my ballet recital (which she had tickets for) and I was a bit hurt by this as I didn't do anything to them.  I haven't even discussed this issue at all with them and so them just lashing out at me is kind of irrational.  Things have gotten a little better and they are moving out of town so it will help that we don't need to see them at all, maybe just at holidays.  I never had a super close relationship with them but I don't understand how parents can hate their child and not support their child like this.  I grew up with really open-minded parents who did not mind that I was pan-sexual and dated both males and females and I wish her parents were like that.  It's been very hard on her dealing with coming out at work (which actually led to some events that caused her to quit but she now has a new job which is going really well) and I know it's hard for her that her parents won't even try to understand. I don't really want to see them again since they are being really immature.

My best friend, John, suggested our friend's group should take a unique vacation earlier this year, and he heard good things about these new rock cruises where you travel with the band. I am pretty much open to any type of music anyway, but rock is easily near the top of my list of genres.

All of my friends had a blast on the cruise too, and I barely even noticed the fact that we were so far out on the water. The last night ended up being a massive blowout concert that seemed to go on for hours. The atmosphere was so perfect that I'm not sure it's possible to ever forget how great the experience was.

I decided to stay on until the end of overnights.  The whole experience was interesting, oftentimes frustrating, quite challenging, and new.  I'd never worked in retail before so it was all a learning experience.  Even more challenging than that, I pushed myself very hard and my body struggled to keep up.  My knees were regularly swollen to the size of softballs, my back constantly ached and my fingers were all cut up from tearing corrugated cardboard.

They were good people and usually hard workers, even if they weren't from my background or didn't occupy the same social strata as me.

We should pass it between each team member and then the most experienced team member should put the item on the store shelf.  Someone then joked that they should drop it and we all laughed.  At the end of the night we all felt good because we'd finished all the freight.  It was nice to finish with a ""win.""  We then went to the break room to get our stuff and go home.  We all shook hands and thanked each other for the work we'd done, and told each other what a pleasure it had been to work together.

1009,"As I sit here watching my beautiful newborn son sleep, I'm finally able to reflect on his birth story. What a story! I really wanted to have a natural birth - it was written down on my birth plan and everything. When contractions started at home, they were very sporadic. Over the next 72 hours, I labored slowly at home, practicing every pain management technique I had researched (the bathtub worked best for me). Towards the third day, the pain was intense and the doctor recommended I check into the hospital. As I settled in, the nurses recommended I get an epidural to help manage the pain. As I waited on the epidural, they suddenly ordered an ultrasound. It scared me a little. Was something wrong? Everything looked fine on the screen, to me. When the doctor came in, he gave me the news. My baby had turned from head down to transverse and there wasn't time to try to turn him. The baby monitor showed signs of distress. I had no choice but to have an emergency c-section. They put me to sleep and when I woke up, my husband told me our son was beautiful. I couldn't wait to hold him! It was all worth it when my sweet baby boy was placed in my arms and I was finally able to gaze into his chubby little face. I love him so much!",False,False,False,B,True
1010,"Almost 6 months ago I began a journey that I didn't anticipate when my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. There was little warning and no outward signs that definitively pointed to any form of dementia at all. Oh, there was the occasional forgetfulness and a few times the month before her diagnosis where she called me one day to tell me something and then called again three days later to tell me the same thing again. But that only occurred the month prior. My aunt and I compared notes that month and she had experienced the same thing and that was the first clue that anything was wrong. My mother retired to Florida about 20 years ago, my aunt lives in Ohio and I live in Texas and we get to see each other maybe once a year. My mother is 80 so she doesn't do email or text and she doesn't have a smartphone, just the old style flip phone with the big numbers on it. But we all talk to each other almost every week, that is, we used to talk to each other each week until this past March when we saw the first signs. Then April rolled around and that's the month of my birthday and she always calls on that day but this year there was no call. I let it pass and didn't think much of it until my aunt called me towards the end of April when we both realized neither of us had spoken to her for the entire month. We call my brother went over there and found her in bed pretty much incoherent, the condo was a mess and she mumbled something about falling. He took her to the hospital to get her checked out and the doctor said there were no signs of a stroke but he saw bruising on her hip, knee and arm and noted that he thought she probably had taken a bad fall so she stayed in the hospital for a few days under observation. The doctor told them she needed a walker because her knee was not supporting her weight very well and also advised them to have her schedule an appointment with her primary physician because she probably needed a brain scan to rule out other causes of her confusion. It was 3 weeks before she was able to get the brain scan and the confirmed diagnosis at that point was Alzheimer's. She was in a long term care facility within a month and she started losing ground fast. She no longer recognized anyone and she couldn't use the phone at all anymore so no more phone calls. After 2 months she quit eating and they had to put her in hospice which is where she remains today. She gets more attention there and has recovered at least some of the body weight she lost because she simply didn't experience or recognize hunger any longer. We've all learned several hard lessons around this development. Alzheimer's now runs in the family and all 4 of us kids now have an increased chance of being diagnosed with it. I'm 64 and I have to think about the burden that puts on my kids and my wife. 5 months ago? It didn't even register on my list of possibilities but Alzheimer's just changed my life and I don't even have it. Yet.",True,True,True,B,True

1023,"I had the most uplifting experience a month ago.  I was approached by the pastor at my church in regards to teaching Vacation Bible School. I have to say I was shocked at the thought of teaching children about the Bible. It is a subject that I struggle to understand myself.  I voiced this concern to my pastor. He told me that is the reason he wanted me to take the role of the teacher. His believed this experience would help me understand the teachings of the Bible and at the same time benefit the children. After careful consideration, I agreed to teach Vacation Bible School. I must say this endeavor turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was assigned to a class of 7-9 year-olds. The children in this age group were inquisitive and full of wonder. I immersed myself fully into each lesson. The decision that I made to undertake this challenge was one of the best I have ever made. I learned more about the Bible during that week than I had learned in my entire life. The children were responsible for opening my mind up to all the things that were confusing to me concerning the teachings of the Bible.  The children had an awareness that I hadn't before this week of teaching. They graciously shared their stories and opinions on the lessons I was teaching. That was one of the best weeks in my life. I am so glad that I participated in the event. My pastor was right about this aiding in my understanding of the teachings of the Bible. During that week of Vacation Bible School, many of the questions that were always pulling at my mind were answered by innocent children.

I checked my voicemail and this time it wasn't what did John do, it was what had happened to him. I found out John was in the ICU and on life support and that Dan asked me if I wanted to come with him to the hospital because the doctors had requested he come, he was the emergency contact.  I had my sister come watch my daughter while I went with Dan to the hospital. John was there, intubated and sedated and they said that he isn't going to die but they had to intubate him because they had to sedate him, he was combative with them when they were trying to help him he was also put in restraints so he couldn't fight anymore or try to hurt the nurses and doctors. I had told the doctor what I know about John and his problem with drugs and mental health I told them it was probably a suicide attempt, even had a notebook with a suicide note written for me, actually had that for a while no date on it. After his stay in the ICU he was taken to the psychiatric unit where he stayed a month and got treated for his major depression and also PTSD. I was hoping this would change him and he actually agreed that if this didn't nothing would.

We had spent months trying to find the perfect one to bring into our home. Then we finally found Louie, a perfect little springer spaniel. The only problem was that he was a couple of states over. We planned a road trip to go pick him up, and it was going to take us about 8 hours to get there. We were all super excited and began our trip on Friday morning. Dad didn't check the car for any problems as it's usually fine, but we all definitely regret not convincing him to. We were only 2 hours into the ride when the car started to smell a little a funky. We didn't think much of it since we just wanted to see our cute new puppy. Then after another hour the check engine light came on and that was a sign for the worst. Only 3 hours into the trip and the engine was billowing smoke all over the highway. Turns out the radiator blew and it wasn't going to be possible to keep driving. The owner of the puppy said we had to be there as it was a first come first serve deal and the puppy was definitely wanted by more people than us. Without a way to keep on going, Dad called up AAA and had them tow the car. They couldn't tow the car to where we were going and then back, so we had to cancel the trip and go home. Because of this we missed on the opportunity to get the puppy. Since then we've been very demotivated to try and find a new puppy.",False,False,False,B,True

I wasn't the only one she tormented. I would hear her lashing out at other girls, and even some of the more timid boys. Her favorite insults to hurl at the boys were often ""Faggot!"" or ""Pussy!""

The one he had was not really cutting it for our finances, and money was really tight. We found that we were spending more money each month than we were earning. It was a very stressful time for us. My husband found a great job that paid almost three times his previous salary. He also got a signing bonus that allowed us to put down a down payment for a larger vehicle. We had to take two cars to get our whole family somewhere, and now we can all fit in our (new to us) van! We bought a 2012 Honda Odyssey and the color is a gorgeous deep red. We got a really good deal on it, and while I never really wanted a minivan, I'm glad that everyone can finally fit in one car. I was surprised how much I loved it! We were also able to catch up on our electricity and gas bills. We weren't behind a whole bunch but it was refreshing to finally be able to reach a balance of zero! It is so refreshing to be able to pay the bills. We have some money saved up now to get the kids some great gifts for Christmas. We won't be taking our newly found financial freedom for granted.

1093,"It has always been my desire of mine to help my mother buy a home. She lives in the same city that she was born and has never moved. It is a large metropolitan area. She is frequently annoyed by the traffic during her commute and how crowded the city has become. For years, she was resistant to the idea of moving to another location. She would emotionally shut down when I tried to persuade her to move to the suburbs. I firmly believed that she would be happier in a less crowded location and that she would enjoy the extra space. Earlier this year, she lost a close friend that lived nearby. During her grieving process, she would frequently state that life is too short to deny yourself the things that you truly want. Finally she has a change of perspective. She confided in me that she was ready and had the courage to move. She did not want to be stuck in an area that while familiar, was not a good fit for her.  She was ready to conquer her fears of an unknown environment and move to a new location. I immediately embraced her decision and we started looking for a new home together. I suggested some towns that would be a good fit for her. We were able to find a home in her price range and close to a major highway. Another added benefit is that the home is in a quieter neighborhood and my mother finally has a large garden. This was a childhood dream that took years to actualize.

1095,"My sister's death came as a surprise to all of us. We all knew that she had a lot of problems, but I guess we were all just too busy in our lives to do anything about it. I still remember coming home that day to an empty house. The lights were all off and it was as still as you can possibly imagine. As I called out her name walking up the stairs I began to panic. If only I had treated her condition with the same sense of urgency a few hours ago, maybe this all could have been avoided. I blame myself a lot for what happened. And the timing of it all, as sick is it may seem, just makes me feel that she was trying to get back at me for something. Maybe for following all of the rules. For going to school. Getting a good job. Listening to our parents. Maybe in her state of mind she wasn't quite thinking so far ahead, but as fate would have it, I was the one who got to witness her lifeless corpse hanging from the ceiling by a telephone cord, the blood dripping down her ankles. I let out a scream. I felt like I was in a movie. And there was nothing that could have been done. Every year in May we gather together and reflect on her life. What we could have done differently.

1099,"Parenting a child with behavioral issues might just be the hardest thing I have ever done.  When our son, Jackson, started preschool, notes and telephone calls from his teachers regarding his inattentiveness began almost immediately.  He had difficulty sitting still during circle time and couldn't keep his hands and feet to himself.  He often started an activity, scribbled something on a piece of paper, and then would walk off to begin another activity. He couldn't concentrate long enough to finish his work.  This pattern of behavior followed him to elementary school where the classes were larger and the interruptions and misbehavior had bigger implications.  My husband and I had always recognized that Jackson had difficulties keeping himself occupied at home.  We eventually stopped attending church because his disruptiveness during the service was embarrassing. He'd crawl under the pews, roll around on the floor, and would often yawn loudly during sermons.  Despite our best efforts to discipline him, set boundaries, and accommodate his misbehavior, we felt like we were failing him.  Eventually, when he turned seven, we took him to his pediatrician, and she immediately diagnosed him with ADHD.  We felt a sense of relief that we had professional confirmation.  That was four months ago, and my husband and I are still grappling with both his diagnosis and whether or not to medicate him.  I've talked with several friends and family members who either have ADHD themselves or parent a child with the disorder.  The parents almost unanimously sing the praises of medication, claiming that the positive effects completely outweigh the negative effects such as lack of appetite.  However, the feedback from those who have ADHD and have taken medication has been somewhat of a mixed bag.  Some have told us about the depression that seems to appear once the medication regime has begun.  Others claim that lack of appetite is by far the worst side effect.  They all have conceded that they are more focused, able to complete work or activities, and feel like they are able to fit in with peers during events.  My husband and I remain undecided as to whether or not we want Jackson to take medication that might help him succeed in school, but would come at a price.  Do the benefits outweigh the costs, and are we willing to gamble with our son's brain and mental state in order for him to ""fit in?""

I am a nurse and so immediately my skills kicked in. His mommy was on the floor and about to deliver her baby. The lady spoke little english and was so afraid and kept saying ""help me"". I know a little Spanish to get by and tried calming her.  I told the little boy to dial 911 on my phone and hold it to my ear while I talked to them.

There was also an argument that broke out between my sister and my aunt about politics that left the memory of the event slightly soured. They started arguing about Socialism and it turned into an argument about a variety of things from global warming to Donald Trump. My mother ended up joining in, which is unusual for her. My aunt is very against Socialism and supports Trump. My sister and mother are against Trump. My sister is also very worried about the environment and said that is the reason why she will not have kids. While they were arguing, I said nothing. I had hoped politics would not come up.

However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy.  They are jealous of his popularity and his alleged perfection.   Before practice 4 kids circled him up and pushed him around while taunting him with emotionally scarring words that effected his game play during practice.  He didn't want to turn the kids in because he felt that that would cause more problems, but he did choose to share his concerns with me -as a way to vent.  He and I went for a long run to get it out of our systems.   I couldn't sleep that night, I was angry at the kids and upset for my son.  Even though he said he was ok, I knew that he wasn't and I could see the hurt and frustration in his eyes.  The next day, I called the coach and took it upon myself to report the situation.

1116,"At the end of May, me, my 2 kids, and my soon to be ex husband moved into my dads house. This was the house I grew up in, and the house my children will spend most of their growing years in. My husband and I were having financial troubles and we knew something had to change soon. My dad graciously agreed to let us move in and make any changes we saw fit. Our current plan is for my husband to look for a new job, one that pays him more than his current job, and save enough money to move out into his own apartment. As you can imagine, this can make for a stressful experience for a few reasons. One, we are divorcing, so we do not always see to eye and seeing each other constantly does not help our situation. Two, in the beginning it was quite rough moving back home to the house I grew up in. I felt like I had failed. Watching all my peers on social media get engaged, get married, buy a house, only added to that feeling. This feeling thankfully, did not last long. I now feel like this is my house, and I am happy to give my kids some stability, rather than moving apartments every few years. I did not realize how much of an effect moving had on me or my older son until one day shortly after we moved he made me promise that we wouldn't move again. Now more than ever, stability is important to me. That was probably one of the most surprising parts of the move, how it affected him, and how for the first time I felt like I had truly failed on my end as a parent to provide him with a stable home. The second part was feeling how I had failed as an adult by not being able to live on my own like I ""should"". Living with my dad again has some perks, like he is always around to babysit, and there are drawbacks as well. He is not the cleanest person and so that is frustrating.

My daughter had complained to our mutual employer (in Chicago) that she had never flown in an airplane and that it was the only item on her bucket list. The next week, they offered to fly us out for a meeting and a lunch with them! I decided to take the entire family and make a nice little vacation out of it. We had a fantastic visit with my employers. After a short meeting, they took us to a great Greek restaurant where I tried several new foods. From there, we went to our hotel which was located in the heart of the city. We visited an architecture museum and learned a lot about the origins of the city. We also went to see The Bean, which is a chrome bean that is absolutely enormous and sits in the middle of a park. We went to the Navy Pier and had some great food. The highlight (or perhaps the lowlight) of the trip was our lunch where we ate traditional Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza was unreal- so thick and cheesy! Even though I was starving I could only eat a single slice. But just as we were eating, the city got hit with a tremendous thunderstorm. I have never encountered anything like it before. It was downright traumatizing though fortunately, it passed quickly. We wrapped up the short trip after another day of museum hopping and shopping. Although I could have spent another week in the city, I feel fortunate to have enjoyed the time I did with my family.",True,True,True,B,True

The flight went as well as a flight in coach could go. We arrived late to our exotic, all-inclusive resort. There was no person at the front desk. Only a key with our names on it. We took the key, but wondered which private hut it opened. We were tired and confused. We started, one by one, trying to open the huts. After four or five tries and bothering a few other guests, we found the keys match. My love swept me up and carried me over the threshold. We are finally settling into our honeymoon. Tomorrow we will wake up late and relax by the beach. I am a very happy and lucky woman to have this time with my best friend. I really do love him so much.",True,True,False,B,False

The only place to take a walk that was safe was on the country road across from my house where there was a little cemetery.  It was a beautiful sunny day and there was a warm breeze blowing the smell of the newly blossomed lilacs in the air.  I couldn't see any lilac trees or bushes but figured there must be one behind the little storage building in the cemetery and the scent was blowing towards us.  I decided to push the stroller with my little grandson on the sidewalks within the cemetery.  Within minutes, my little grandson asked, ""Grandma, what's that smell?""  I sometimes answer his questions with a question to see what he is thinking.  So I asked him, what do you think it is?  To which he replied, I didn't know dead people smelled so good.  I will never forget that day and sure enough after we walked behind the storage shed, there stood a beautiful lilac bush.  I didn't want my little grandson thinking dead people smelled good, so I showed him where the smell was coming from.  We just never know what the little ones will say.  There are truly innocent and filled with wonder.  My walk through the cemetery was fun and educational.  One of the joys of being a grandmother!

1135,I work in medical tech and am pretty well known in the field. When my partner and I went to attend a conference I had no idea we were intended to give a speech. The conference had many doctors and researchers from around the world there. When they asked me to come up and speak I decided to go up and give it my best effort but I froze up. I didnt have slides or models. I was talking about a device that I could not show off or effectively communicate our product. I think i lost some clout with these people as I floundered and didnt know what to say. I know if i were being explained a medical procedure or device i would want someone well versed in it.

Amber, the bride, looked stunning and her bridesmaid's also. We rented a farmhouse next to a lake as the venue. The weather was perfect, which is a rare occurrence in the deep south. Not too hot and not too cold.  The only potential problem was me. I have a terrible fear of public speaking and the best man is required to do a lot of that. But it was my little brother's wedding. I had a duty and the great honor of being the best man. I could not fail him or let my anxiety rule the day. In this case, being the best man also afforded me the opportunity to be there for my family and little brother and to work on myself as a human being, conquering my anxiety about public speaking and rising to the occasion. I learned that most anxiety is anticipatory, and that once the speech has begun, things are easier. So the speech and toast went off without a hitch.

After 3 weeks, I felt stronger both spiritually, physically, and mentally. I was able to keep my composure in stressful situations with less effort.

I was a little grumbly about it as I was really busy that day and didn't really have time for this. I already had a few other errands to run so I was already behind on what needed to be done that day. Thankfully, I didn't need to get much at the store, just some perishables. I had just finished checking out and pushed the small shopping card to my car, umbrella in hand. As I begun loading the car with the groceries, a small black car rolled up next to me and rolled down it's window. Thinking they were going to comment on my political bumper stickers I thought ""Oh boy, here we go!"". Wasn't exactly in the mood for a political conversation and just wanted to get out of there. Well, the guy in the car said ""Hey, are you (my name, first and last) by any chance?"" Skeptical, I said ""Yes, I am. Do I know you?"" The voice sounded familiar, though distantly and I couldn't place it. He told me his name and that we went to high school together. His name sounded really familiar, dang it...couldn't place it but I did feel I knew him at some point. After chatting with him in the rain for a moment it hit me all at once who this was. This was one of the handful of people who was nice to me in high school! Oh my God! This was a rare someone I actually hung out with in high school! Given I was bullied without mercy and was a hardcore recluse (still am something of a recluse to this day), that was a big feat! My mouth dropped open and I said ""1-800-555-ElCheapo!!!"" El Cheapo was this sarcastic series of letters we wrote from dark or incompetent characters such as King Koopa or Bozo the Clown that came up with ideas and rules for the school that we didn't like or felt were unfair to the teachers/school board encouraging them to enact these rules. It was sort of a parody and lampoon of the school as a whole. Great way to vent and relieve stress given we were both sort of on the social fringe of the school. He said ""Yeah man, that's it!"", recalling it! After graduation we had lost touch and this was the first I'd seen of him in 20 years. We chatted for quite a while in the rain, catching up on life. We exchanged contact information before moving on with our day. So that day went from bad, frustrating, and annoying to a huge smile on my face.",True,True,True,B,True

I was reluctant to go at first, because the idea of sharing a bodies of water with tons of young children and random people didn't sound so great to me. However, as we pulled up to the water park I found myself beginning to look forward to a day spent in the sun with the people I care about. We showed our tickets and walked into the park proper. It was pretty much what I expected, families milling about, groups of teenagers and couples. We got in line and began the long wait for the water slide. We didn't think much of passing on the more expensive 'Fast Pass' tickets, but as time dragged on we began to wonder if we hadn't made a mistake. It was a full 50 minutes before our turn came, with about five or six Fast Pass groups going before us in that time. Definitely going to consider the Fast Pass next time. We made the most of it, however, and grabbed some food and few cold drinks. I went with a beer, but my girlfriend and friend each got frozen margaritas. After finishing our food we opted against another wait in a long line, opting for the Lazy River instead. The Lazy River was a loop in the center of the water park. To could either diver right in or wait in line for someone to finish and leave their tube on the side. After a couple of rounds on that we were ready for the wave pool, a pool that generated artificial waves every so often. There was a dj, but he played mostly family-friendly, ages old, corny music.

So around 2am or so, we both sneak out of the house and start walking towards the graveyard. The graveyard was pretty far, around a mile or so away. There is a shortcut through a wooded section that saves a little bit of time, and we decided to use that. It was very dark and quiet in the woods.

You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that.  As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower. I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free. She came over within an hour and thought I was going crazy. She did help me and knew of a family that might be interested in purchasing my house. Over the next few days I spend my time between cleaning, selling and getting organized. The family who were interested in purchasing came to have a look at it while I was still getting organized. The family were in urgent need of a place to live as they were moving from a different state but nothing could have prepared me for selling my house within 3 weeks and with a cash sale.",False,False,False,B,True

I have never been overseas in my whole life. The furthest I have ever been to in my life was Canada.  I saw in Russia so many sights. I saw the Kremlin. I saw the Bolshoi theater and a ballet performance there. I got to taste some good Russian cuisine like beef stroganoff. Napoleon cakes are delicious. I spent immense quality time with my dad in the trip which lasted two and a half weeks. I also made day trips to the Russian countryside. I experienced life in the small villages. Very humble life there. I am literally longing to go back to Russia very soon. I truly miss it. I went to countless museums and Red Square.,True,True,True,B,True

1190,"I was re-doing my kitchen my neighbor had a free stove that he let me have. 2 months ago Building a strong relationship with your landlord is akin to having strong ties with your parents or siblings. It‚Äôs often difficult, and sometimes it can even seem impossible, but in the long run, it‚Äôs more than worth it. When you need a favor, a landlord who likes you (like a trusted family member) can be a real lifesaver. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to bake them cookies or mow their lawn. Just pay your rent on time, let them know immediately if you ever need a little more time to gather the money, and don‚Äôt make a habit of paying late. Beyond that, just make sure you know your landlord-tenant rights both locally and nationally, and your relationship should be easy-going and mutually beneficial. No matter where you live, specific rights apply to all tenant-landlord relationships, regardless of whether they‚Äôre spelled out in or omitted from your particular lease agreement. These include but are not limited to the right to receive police assistance in emergency situations free of charge, the right not to cover a landlord‚Äôs legal fees in the event of a dispute that ends up in court, and the prohibition of landlords from discriminating against prospective tenants on the grounds that they have children. Similarly, the law dictates that all tenants have a certain set of responsibilities inherent to their rental agreements. For instance, tenants are required to pay their rent in full on the day outlined in their lease. Tenants must use amenities like parking .lots and laundry rooms responsibly and without causing harm or destruction to them. Tenants are obligated to dispose of all waste materials such as car batteries, motor oil, and electronics in a safe and proper manner. It was a surprise encounter at just the right moment. It was good timing since I hadn't talked to my neighbor in a while before this. In addition, some states, counties, cities, and municipalities have laws and statutes in place that expressly prohibit tenants from participating in gang activity, physical assault, or the sale/purchase of illegal substances. Unlawfully using a firearm on the premises is another hard no. you feel like your rights have been violated, contact your local tenants‚Äô rights organization for assistance. In the event that they agree that your rights may have been violated or that the landlord‚Äôs demands are illegal, seek legal assistance to determine your options. Ignoring disputes usually only escalates the problem and creates bad blood between you and your landlord .a situation that can seriously tarnish your peaceful home life.

I had spent years preparing for this--building my credit score up, saving money, researching loan types, finding a good mortgage broker, and so on. Once I finally felt ready, the search for the right house took more than a year. The market in my area was very hot, so I lost out on several potential houses because the sellers chose to accept another offer. I did not even make an offer on most of the houses I saw. The hot market had caused a lot of ""flipped"" properties to hit the market as sellers hastened to take advantage of high prices--and many of those had obviously poor quality renovation work, some of which was in violation of local regulations. Some homes had not had any work done at all and were in extremely poor condition for the price, requiring extensive and expensive repairs just to become habitable. It did not help that I was trying to buy a home at a lower price range. Finally, however, I was lucky. The sellers of the house I ended up buying had originally accepted another offer instead of mine. The buyer they chose backed out at the closing table. Another buyer was selected, but they were unable to follow through with their offer due to financing issues. I was the third choice, but my offer was solid and we closed on schedule--April 26th, which happens to be my birthday. At long last, I had finally bought my very first house. I was so proud and excited, but I was also mentally exhausted from the years of preparation and searching. Even more work was yet to come. The house I bought was habitable, but I wanted to do some work on the inside prior to moving in: cleaning, patching, painting. I did most of this work personally, with the help of my partner and father, while also working full-time and attending college part-time. After about a month of work, we finally moved in all of our belongings. I am not sure how I managed to accomplish all of this, but somehow I did. I appreciate the support of my partner and my family. I still think about this event daily, with pride and a lingering touch of disbelief. It is still sometimes hard for me to believe that I finally own my own house!",True,True,True,B,True

1207,"One early spring morning, waking up and rolling heavily to the side of the bed I felt a strange sensation in my abdomen. It can be described as a big drop of water that falls on your umbrella and you feel the vibration of it in the handle. Then my water broke. It was nothing like I imagined. And so the task of a long labor began. Twelve hours plus later, when my strength was running thin the medical team arrived to help deliver the baby. I was eagerly anticipating seeing her and holding her in my arms for the first time. You hear the cry and you look at the red baby that the doctor holds in his hands, and then the nurse takes the baby and brings it on your chest. That moment when the baby first lays on your chest is magic. You go from hearing a crying baby to quiet time. And I say quiet because, besides the fact that baby stopped crying, I honestly did not hear anything else that happened around me afterwards. Looking at the baby girl was all I was able to do. Awed, amazed, and thankful for such a blessing! Brown fine hair covered her little head, she had her eyes open and her head turned towards me, her skin was pink and wrinkled, and looked soft, she had all ten fingers and toes and that felt ridiculously reassuring, even though I already knew that the newborn was physically healthy. The nurse dried her and wrapped her loosely in a newborn blanket. I was then able to hold her for the first time. She had her little fingers in her mouth and was quietly looking up at my face, somewhat expectant. I looked in the dark blue eyes of my little angel and tears of joy filled my eyes. It felt euphoric and unreal to hold my own baby in my arms. She was light and fragile, she felt warm, and she looked so content. I touched her little wrinkled fingers and she clasped my finger in a tight grasp! All I could focus on was her.",True,True,True,B,True
1208,"Moving a long distance is a very stressful process, especially when you are moving away from home. It's hard not only physically, with having to sort and pack and sell your things. It's hard emotionally too - leaving behind family and friends. I left behind all of my family and most of my friends - minus a few that live in Colorado already. It was sad to drive away but I was glad to have my dad with me. We saw a lot of interesting sights on our travels, including a family of moose. They were tall and elegant and beautiful but also scary to watch from the road. One of the highlights of the trip was the food we got to eat. I made sure to have a lot of BBQ and Cajun before we left Louisiana. I would not be able to have it again until I came back for Christmas in a few months. My dad and I enjoyed the time to relax from the road and also eat good food together. We ate a lot and then would be super full getting back into the car for the long drive ahead. One of the worst things that happened on our trip was a flat tire that happened in Texas. We were far away from other people and had to wait hours for triple A to come and help us fix it. Even though it was November it was luckily not too cold and we didn't freeze while we waited. I was very glad to have my dad as company or I would have been terrified waiting in the car in the middle of nowhere for that long. It was sad when my dad had to leave to go back home.

1212,"I recently moved to a new apartment around three months ago.  The thing with this apartment is, that I almost did not have any to go.  I was at the end of my lease in my old apartment and I had not put in an application at a new apartment because I hadn't had the extra money to pay for the application fees, etc.  I was experiencing some financial difficulties, so money was scarce.  I did not anticipate this money shortage at the time that I turned in my 60-day notice to move.  So, time to move is getting closer.  I was checking with this new apartment complex. In speaking with them, they had promised that they would be ready for me to move in right around the time that my lease was up.  I had sent them several emails and they had sent me the link to apply.  This was so that the apartment would be ready for move-in when I moved out of my current space.  I really tempted, but I ended up not doing the application at that time.  About a week later I check with them again and they informed me that they were about a month behind schedule and the apartment would be ready around two weeks after my move-out date.  I then started looking at other complexes.  I finally found a nice place and put in the application.  Upon completion, I found out that the apartment that I lived in before my current apartment had put a cleaning charge of over $1,500 on my credit so they did not want to rent to me.  Around now, the lease is up and I have to go!!!! My current apartment had been rented to someone else so I could not stay there.  What am I going to do????

We all scheduled to meet up at Disney due to the logistical nature of getting everyone together without needing to drive everywhere.  It was quite odd to realize that I had organized something so big (there were about 8 of us.).  It truly felt great, like we had been able to forget the problems we had with the world for a few days.  We had first went to Disney Springs, which is basically a sprawling row of shops.  We got some cigars, went to a bar, went bowling, and all around just had a truly great day.  The second day of the trip we went to Magic Kingdom, which is a really big theme park.  We basically cared more about hanging out than the actual destination, but we did have some good food, and some good fun.  Third day, unfortunately was time for all of us to go back.  We have begun planning future vacations together ever since, I feel it's a major event. It's gotten many conversations going and still provides us entertainment remembering the goofy things that happened.  I think it was a milestone in my life, as short as the trip was, it showed me that it's ok to meet people, it's ok to let people into your life.

This was a normal day like any other and I had both of my siblings moving away for college, we had a rather normal day watching tv, namely avatar the last airbender, we watched it like we always do on sunday evenings and it was honestly kind of depressing knowing it was the last time for years we would do it. The day was fast, we all talked and laughed and we cleaned up my sisters room together to get everything we wanted out of it before she left, I remember watching her walk up her stairs and go out the door, and get into her car and leave, it was a little heartbreaking. My brother just left, we had both cleaned his room too and he was ready to go, he had been getting in fights and arguing with my mom a lot, they were both ready for him to go. They had both prepared for college and were going to be leaving soon around 6pm, they were getting ready to go on with their lives, and to live their futures without me. I felt happy for them, I know they were both going to do great things, one was going to art school in new Jersey and the other was going to study Dance in Chicago, both prestigious places. I did feel great sadness though, they were two of my closest friends, two people who really understood me, and they were both leaving, and I had few other people to talk to. I tried to get them involved in everything before they went, I tried mini-golfing,movie watching, mystery shopping and just plane video games and board games, and we did have a blast, but it was depressing knowing they were still going to leave the very next week. I even got them involved in money making schemes like apps and survey programs, but they weren't interested, my best friends they may have been but they still didn't share all my interest. I also tried to get them involved in Overwatch and Minecraft and other online games so we could have things to do and they agreed to play but they unfortunately faded out of them, and they left our group. They still continued to chat every once and while and we watch shows streamed but they get farther and farther away chatting with their own groups and making new friends, I try but its hard to get them interested and they're growing more and more distant, and it hurts.

1217,"Lifestyle and career are two important, intertwined aspects of everyone's daily lives. A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things.

Even though mom is in her own home, she is unaware of her surroundings, which is more the case lately. I have to keep reassuring mom that she is at home. As the full moon gets higher in the sky, the more restless mom becomes and goes to each door trying to open the door. When the door doesn't open, mom then proceeds to each window, fortunately, most window locks are higher up or too hard for her to open.

Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions.

Each person comes in with their own personalities, pasts, goals, strengths & weaknesses. A couple months ago someone who has worked with our house before had recommended a new guy to me. He explained to me that he was struggling in another house with other guys harassing him and making it hard for him to sleep. I took this new guy in without fully vetting him personally, because I trusted the person who was vouching for him. This turned out to be a mistake on my part, and a lesson learned. As it turned out, the problems he was having in his last sober living was related to the manic episode he was going through that our mutual friend was unaware of when he brought him to my sober living. For the next 3 weeks the entire house was on edge. He was abrasive, intense, and was always trying to do things his own way instead of following the rules. Most of these rules were little things that we give warnings about, we give people a chance to correct them, and because he didn't break any major rules I couldn't just kick him out. I COULD have, but I wouldn't feel right doing it, for something so small. As time went on it became clear to me that this was not going to change. We went to great lengths to give him a real opportunity to make it work at our house. He got on the right medication and was taking it, we were giving him plenty of 'growing room'. When it became apparent to me that this was going to be an issue, I decided I would give him advanced notice that we would not be accepting his next months fees and he should start looking for a new place to live. After hearing this, he tried to turn a new leaf - apologize to people in the house, apologize to me, but by then the damage had already been done and the people were incredibly uncomfortable living with him.

I made it very clear, but it was obvious to me he was not fully comprehending it, he was in deniable about the situation.

He had this really fluffy white rug beside his bed and his bed sheets and comforter looked really comfortable. He also had a ""bed in a suitcase"" thing that I didn't have when I moved into college.

We had been looking for aplace like that since we moved to the area three years ago. Nothing was available at the time, so we rented a home in town, and have since boarded the horses several different places. Most recently, they have been at a large horse facility several miles away, that my wife has to commute to once or twice a day. We are very pleased to be moving to a more rural location, without the traffic noise and close neighbors we have here. We will be a bit disappointed to be further away from all the amenities and entertainment we enjoy here in town, and can cycle to, but we will adjust. It's no further of a commute to work for me in terms of time than where we are now. I'm really looking forward to the quiet and being able to see the stars again! It is stressful to pack up and move right now, with the garden burgeoning and my summer field schedule at work. I am having to take almost two weeks off of work, and have a lot to do, so I will have to keep checking in as we proceed with our packing, moving and cleaning. I will be relieved when this move is over and we are settled in. The landlord is a colleague of my wife's in her equestrain group, and is very nice. The horses will love being in the country, and not competing with all the other horses at the boarding stable. I can't wait to be there, but am dreading the moving tasks.

I work up in the hospital to my whole family being there, at least that is what they told me as my memory of the day is hazy, which was nice. It was the since I was liked 4 years old that I had ever been in a hospital. I basically just sat on a bed while they ran tests on me. Luckily nothing was bad at all, I had no broken bones or trauma or anything. I did have to stay overnight in the hospital just so they could evaluate me to me fully sure I was fine since I was still very lightheaded.

1357,"Dear Diary,  I recently went through a very emotional time in my life. My grandma in Oregon passed away a couple weeks ago. The process was painful to hear about and it hit me harder than I thought it would. I was very close with my grandma and so was my mom. My mom's siblings put her on Hospice about three weeks ago and within a week she was gone. There was a lot of family drama over the passing of her and I did not agree with with how she was taken care of in the end. I feel she was pushed into the direction of death by being heavily medicated and her family members that were there were not getting her up out of bed anymore. I realize people get old and everyone's time comes but I feel like it wasn't her time yet. But you can't go back in time and she's gone now. I was able to travel with my parents and sister to Oregon to attend her funeral. It was an emotional roller coaster. The hardest day for me was when the day before her funeral I found out that there had been rules put in place by my Uncle that no grand kids were going to be able to go view my grandma and say goodbye. Because of all the drama, he wanted to hurt everyone he could that wasn't on his side. I went to the funeral home with my parents anyway in hopes that I might still get a chance. After arguing with the funeral director, it was decided that I would not be able to go in the room. I was crushed, I was so hurt and upset but I was trying to hold it together for my mom. My mom was able to go in for a while and sit with her mom so I waited outside with other family members. After some time, my mom came outside in a hurry and told me to come quickly. I didn't know what had happened but apparently the funeral director had a change of heart and decided to go against the request of my Uncle and let me go view my Grandma. Walking in that room was so surreal. I couldn't believe my beloved grandma was laying there in her coffin. I never thought it would bother me as much as it did. I couldn't even bring myself to touch her, I guess I was scared or in denial. It was an emotional couple of weeks to say the least.",True,True,True,B,True

Almost a year ago, my grandma suffered a couple of stroked that put her in the hospital for a while, and moving around different nursing facilities. She was 88 when this happened, she actually was able to go home, for a bit, after the initial stroke but suffered another mild stroke that put her back in nursing homes. She was a strong woman and kept holding on. However, the stroke caused her to start losing her mind a bit and when we would go visit her in the nursing homes, she would have a little bit of clarity but most of the time she was calling out for help and she would pray, especially the Rosary, over and over again 24/7. The nurses always joked that she was going straight to heaven because she prayed so much. We even had a Priest come out a few times to give her last rites but she still held on. My grandma eventually passed away this past April 2019. My cousins, Aunt and I were there when she passed, it was very peaceful. We would watch her as she struggled to breath but was unconscious (probably could hear us still).  We were there for a couple of hours, talking and even joking around and crying in between because our grandma had been with us for so long, it was hard to believe she was dying. My grandma was so strong, she survived losing a baby, husband, her youngest daughter and granddaughter at early ages, she had been through so much. We finally noticed she didn't seem to be breathing anymore and was becoming cold to the touch and we called in the nurse to confirm she had passed and she did. It was very peaceful but, it's weird, I noticed how fast her body became stiff when they took off her mask and covered her up. It was such an emotional moment but, surprisingly, I didn't find myself crying that much. Some 10 years prior I had witnessed my mother pass away from cancer and gone through my younger sister's car accident that killed her, so I thought to myself, ""maybe I'm just done crying."" Regardless of me crying or not, it was such a stressful and emotional situation. There was a sense of peace and relief that it was over because my grandma had suffered so much while in the nursing homes because her mind was going and my family and I were going in to see her almost everyday, so to see her at peace was a relief. However, there was a huge sense of loss because she was so prominent in our lives, it was weird that she would no longer be a part of our lives now.

1401,"This summer, our family friends came to visit from Ireland. The story behind this visit started when I was 10 years old. My family joined a program that brings children over from Belfast, Ireland each summer to stay away from the ""troubles"" and violence that occurs in the summer over there. We were matched up with an 11 year old girl who came and stayed with us for 6 weeks. We quickly bonded. She became the sister I never had (I only have a brother), and she came to stay with us for many summers after that. She is a huge part of my childhood and we grew up together in the summers. The last time she was here was when I was 20... which was 10 years ago. In those last 10 years we both got married, had kids, and got homes of our own. So much had happened, and life passed us by. We kept in occasional touch on Facebook, and knew what was going on in our lives, but we hadn't seen each other in a long time. This July, she came back for the first time in 10 years with her husband (who had been here a few times when we were teens, but as her boyfriend) and two small kids. We got to meet each other's kids and spent a wonderful two weeks together. She stayed at my brother's house and we had get togethers, dinners, baseball games, and other fun activities. When I first saw her, the day after she arrived, I was so joyful. I didn't expect to be so excited, but I was smiling, laughing, and giving her a huge hug. It was a wonderful moment. We spent two weeks together with all of our families and children doing so many fun, memorable things. When they had to leave, it was definitely a bit heartbreaking.

1435,I work at a corporate IT department where we handle repairs and respond to high-level client issues. Recently I was able to fix an urgent problem for a client very quickly. Basically saving the company millions of dollars and reputation. Because of this my bosses decided to thank me and promote me at our monthly IT meeting. Tn front of everyone of course. It was actually pretty awesome. I was excited that I was able to do my job well. It's not often I get this kind of praise in front of a crowd of 100+ people(co-workers). So it's definitely a moment I will remember for a long time. Really burns a fire to work hard and keep a dedicated grind! My immediate boss gave me a small award as well. Once I got back to the office we had pizza and food all ready for the team. I was amazed the company did all this. How often does corporate do this kind of stuff? I would say very rarely so I was pleased.,True,True,True,B,True

1438,"My grandfather, whom I was very close to, died recently. The funeral was two weeks ago. It was hard for me to cope with this because I was very close to him. We arranged the funeral and it was a beautiful ceremony, but it was an awful experience. Not only did I have to deal with the fact that he is gone, I also had to deal with my dad's shoveling of causes. After the funeral, something happened that caused people to leave said funeral in disgust and disdain. I had no idea what happened at first. My grandmother, who suffered quite a bit as a result of her husband passing, was approached by my father. I was being consoled for feeling like I was, but that didn't change the fact that my dad did this. He approached my grandmother, for what I thought was condolences. That would have been well and fine. Unfortunately, that wasn't what happened. I found out that my father took advantage of the fact that grandma was alone and away from people. He tried to convince her to join GLAD, and didn't even bother to feel the room out. I thought it was in really poor taste.",True,True,False,B,False
1439,"It's been a while since I wrote here. Ten months exactly, and about ten months ago something happened that I need to let my feelings out about. I went to a party hosted by my friend Max. He's a really social guy, but I didn't realize how many friends he had. The party was wild and packed. SO many people showed up I couldn't have counted them if I wanted to. This made me pretty jealous for some reason. Since then, I haven't been able to be as close to Max as I once was. He's one of my only friends! Yet, he has so many friends outside of me.

1440,"5 months ago I got my kidney.  I am so grateful towards it.  Being on dialysis was a real bummer.  I wasn't able to work full-time.  I relied on state health benefits, and every day was a struggle.  I seriously contemplated ending my life, because having to spend hours each day hooked up to a machine was really draining.  It absolutely sucked. Now that I have a kidney, I've been able to take over my life.  I am able to work full time.  I am able to spend a lot of time with my friends and family, and I've been able to start enjoying my hobbies more.  Before my time was spent at dialysis, but now I'm able to go hiking, and go on vacations, and go hiking, and just enjoy life. The new kidney has allowed me to appreciate life more too.  Before I got kidney disease, I wasn't really appreciating life for what its worth.  I wasn't able to fully appreciate how meaningful life is and how quickly your desire to live can be taken from you.  I hope that I'll be able to continue this appreciation throughout the rest of my life.  I know I will never again take life for granted.

1441,"Last month I engaged in a project competition at my workplace. The competition had been arranged by the board of directors. The winner was to receive an unknown prize. We were all anxious to see the prize. I was so excited because I had done my research  well. My colleagues and I made a presentation to the board of directors. We were then evaluated and amazingly, my presentation was selected as the best. I was so happy remembering when one of the directors asked a challenging question that I had not expected. I got a promotion from the top rating. I got so excited and happy that I managed to beat all my competitors. I called my family and broke the news. They were all excited and happy for me.

1442,"I still dream about it sometimes.  The cold water and bottom of the ocean that my feet just couldn't touch.  I still think about the panicked state I was in.  My legs completely cramped up and the side of my right torso also cramped and immobile.  Couldn't move, couldn't stay afloat.  Muscles that weren't cramping up now seizing up because of my more awkward and desperate movements to stay afloat.  Taking on water, choking, vision becoming spotty.  I remember blacking out on the surface, my mind overwhelmed with panic.  But then I remember falling into a comfortable embrace of nothingness.  It was so eternally peaceful.  I thought to myself, ""this is it"", I am dead.  But I felt a presence echo through me, so deeply that my whole body shook.  It said one thing only - ""NO"".   I woke up a day later in the hospital.  I was told I was saved by another surfer who saw me drowning.  Even after 26 months I still dream about it, the drowning, the acceptance of death, and the...something else out there.

There must be a reason why I was pulled back.",False,False,False,B,True

1446,"About eight months ago I had my first child with my wife. We were in a cramped apartment at the time living together. We were doing rather well with our money as both of us got promotions in our jobs. It was time to think about moving into a permanent home as our family was going to grow. We decided to contact a realtor about houses in the area. This was pretty scary for both of us. Historically our parents didn't do so well. We were both the first in line in our families to get a college degree and was able to actually make something of ourselves. It was a really exciting time for both of us as well as our baby. It took about two months to find the right house at the right price. I'm so glad we didn't wait any longer as we found out that my wife was pregnant again! We were so thrilled to have another child join us! The realtor took no time in expediting all the services that needed to happen to purchase our starter home. The look on our parents faces were priceless when they saw the house. It's going to be the family house and the go to place, I can just feel it!

1448,"In May, I tested for my red belt in Tae Kwon Do.  This was a significant point, as it's my last belt to test for prior to testing for my Black Belt.  This test is traditionally known to be very difficult, as they want to ensure you understand the amount of effort you will need to put forth in order to obtain the level of Black Belt. I arrived at the studio an hour prior to the beginning of the test.  I was somewhat anxious, but I knew I had to go through this in order to accomplish my overall goal.  I began stretching different parts of my body, to ensure that my body was prepared for the physical demand that is required to obtain this belt.  After stretching, I practiced a few of the kicks, blocks, and punches I would be required to demonstrate on my test.  I also went through some of my forms that I would have to demonstrate knowledge of on the test.  At 6:00p. m., they lined us up.  This signals the beginning of the test, as instructors come to the front of the studio and choose who they will be testing.  Once the black belt instructors went to the front, the lead instructor brought us to attention.  He went through briefly what we would be doing.  Following this, an instructor stepped forward and called my name.  I now knew who would be testing me for the evening.  As the other instructors called on their students, I went and retrieved a chair for my instructor. For the next hour and a half, I went through everything I had been taught since first beginning Tae Kwon Do, demonstrating each kick, punch, block, multiple times.  The jump kicks were very demanding.  I needed a fair amount of rest in between these kicks, as my age and physical shape played into this.  After this, I demonstrated each of the forms.  It was a grueling test, to say the least.  At the end of the test, I was very sweaty and well exhausted.  I received my new belt that night and went home happy.  At home, I felt very sore, which reminded me of how much physical demand is required to obtain the level which I'm currently at in Tae Kwon Do.  I know that the Black Belt test will be much harder, and that I need to use my training period to help me prepare for that evening.",True,True,True,B,True
1449,"Two weeks ago our cat, Baby Kitty didn't come home. I spent two days searching for her, checking the road, checking the animal shelters, emailing the shelters. I checked the cars to be sure she was not stuck anyplace. I was super upset that she was missing since a different cat had gone missing before only to find out that one of our neighbors must have taken it. This story is about the misadventures of our missing cat. Then I went outside one evening a few days later and Baby Kitty came stumbling out of the garage. She could not stand up at all and her head was tilted to the side. She seemed to be in a lot of distress about not standing up, so I grabbed the cat carrier and off we went to the Emergency Vet, since of course this happened after the normal vets are closed. The emergency vet is not really very close since we live in a rural area, so it took about a half hour of listening to her cry to get there! I was super upset and worried about her since I did not know what was wrong with her. The vet diagnosed her with Idiopathic Vestibular Disease, which is sort of a catch all for a few possible causes, inflammation in the brain, or inner ear infection or a brain tumor. They said the only way to tell if it was a brain tumor was with an MRI, which they don't really recommend as a first step. They suggested trying antibiotics first to see if there was any improvement and hope that it was not a brain tumor! We got antibiotics and came home. Baby Kitty had to spend a week in our bathroom since she could not walk very well and I was concerned she would fall down the stairs! My oldest son had to give her the medicines twice a day while we were on Vacation too, so I was worried about him doing it right. Baby Kitty is doing much better, still a bit wobbly and has a slight head tilt still, so we will have to bring her back to the vet for a follow up. The most memorable event of this whole incident is we still do not know where Baby Kitty was for three days when she was missing. We also don't know if the disease happened because she was stuck someplace or if she got stuck because she lost the ability to walk somehow. This whole incident was super upsetting because the last time we had to go to the Emergency Vet our dog did not make it.",True,True,True,B,True
