I got it after the $1000 clunker I bought in high school died on me.  Having a mechanic glance at it would have cost more than it was worth. I went around looking for a newish used car, but I had bad credit from some delinquent bills from college.  Most places wouldn't finance a car without a HUGE down payment.  I was just out of college and had no money and only an entry-level job.  Billy Bob's Used Cars said that they would finance anyone.  The cars in Billy Bobs had the monthly payments stickered onto their windshields.  The prices were less than I'd seen elsewhere.  I was really stressed out about the whole situation.  I was stupid and I rushed through the whole process and didn't carefully read the sales contract.  In the fine print was a little mention of this thing called a \"balloon payment.\"  At the end of the loan, i was expected to pay a lump sum of $1200.  That was why the payments were so reasonable. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and the state Department of Consumer Affairs, but they both said that, while rare, car financing with a balloon payment was legal.  Just because the dealership failed to mention the final payment verbally doesn't mean that there's anything actionable in the agreement because there it was in writing.  I think the dealer and other dealers take advantage of the fact that some people just want to get the odious process over and done with as quickly as possible.  It is just an embarrassing episode that I don't like to talk about. I have better credit now, so my bank kindly gave me a loan on the equity of my now 6 year old car.  I really should have more closely read the sales agreement to begin with."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.  I ended up sleeping on the couches of friends and eventually, they got tired of me.  I got another greasy spoon job, but it didn't pay enough to afford rent, especially deposit and utilities.  I could have stayed at a cheap motel, but I figured I was better in the streets.  After being robbed a few times, and run off by cops, I decided to swallow my pride and go to a shelter.

About two hours into this, we decided to go to the grocery store and we bought a lot of snacks.  After six hours it was late night and we were wondering if the power would ever come back on.  We called the power company and they said it could be awhile.  We went to bed and hoped for the best.  We woke up the next morning to no power still.  The power company was now telling us the outages were so bad it could be up to a week for us to regain power.  We were new to the neighborhood and didnt really know anyone.  We were worried about hot water, food going bad, etc.  We went out for the say to forget about things.  When we returned there was a generator sitting on our driveway with a note attached.

I cut out things in my life that were holding me back, making me negative, or were not conducive to being my best self. I gave myself one month to go without social media, lustful thoughts, cussing, television, and sweets. It's definitely been a challenge! Since most people are on a health kick after the New Year, giving up sweets has been relatively easy, though I do sometimes miss having something sweet after dinner. Losing a few pounds has encouraged me to stick with the sweet dessert abstinence. The hardest thing has been giving up television. I have felt very out of touch with what's going on in the world. I also miss some of my favorite shows and find myself wondering if I will have trouble following the story arc once I start watching again. Social media has been surprisingly easy to give up. I guess that's because the negativity on there was really getting to me. I don't miss the drama or the rudeness. I have also found that by focusing my thoughts more positively and not swearing, cussing, or thinking lustful thoughts, I have more energy for creative thoughts. I've written two new poems and have a new story idea to write! Overall, the experience has been very rewarding.

It was by far the longest I've ever spent on a train, and I was super happy to finally get off in Denver, but the ride wasn't so bad. It's way more comfortable than flying because the seats are bigger, with lots of legroom and you can get up to walk around. They even have an observation car with giant windows, although it was usually crowded. Nobody was sitting next to me, so I had tons of room. And there was free wi-fi, so I watched Netflix and did all the normal things on my computer that I would have done if I was at home. All in all it was a pleasant ride. When I got to Denver, I had a few hours to kill before I could check into my hotel room. So I decided I would walk the 5 miles from the train station to the hotel. There just happened to be a nice bike/walking path along a creek that covered most of the distance. It wasn't in a hurry and it was a hot day, so I took my time. I saw lots of breaks to sit and watch the cyclists and joggers pass by. When I finally got to the hotel, I was pretty sweaty and red in the face, and I still had a little more time to kill. So I found a bathroom and freshened up and relaxed in the lounge for a bit. Then I checked in and went to my room. From a quick internet search I saw that there were about 5 dispensaries all within walking distance from my hotel and I could see 3 of them from my room. So I picked the one that had the best reputation and went to buy legal cannabis for the first time. When you first walk into the dispensary, it looks like a boring waiting room. You give your ID to someone and then they buzz you into the main room where everything is for sale. Then you assigned a \"budtender\" who helps you choose what you want to buy.

The first had a lot of medical issues that was a bit much for me  to handle so I did not meet her. The second was a couple of years older than I was anticipating but thought it would be nice to meet her. She was black with while socks and white tip on her tail, very pretty dog. I walked her around the yard and she was so sweet. She did everything I wanted to and seem to have the saddest eyes when she looked up at me. She is 7 years old and seemed to be healthy. She was born in Australia and was raced in China for many years. They closed the race track there and she was kept as one of 600 dogs with no where to go. The rescue group close to me heard of these dogs and was able to get 20 of them out of China. Of the 600 dogs, only 300 were made healthy enough to be rescued out of the country. I couldn't resist, I brought her home. That was 5 months ago. Since then she has become my constant companion. No matter what room I am in, she finds a spot to sit and watch me.

At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day.

This story is about the misadventures of our missing cat. Then I went outside one evening a few days later and Baby Kitty came stumbling out of the garage. She could not stand up at all and her head was tilted to the side. She seemed to be in a lot of distress about not standing up, so I grabbed the cat carrier and off we went to the Emergency Vet, since of course this happened after the normal vets are closed. The emergency vet is not really very close since we live in a rural area, so it took about a half hour of listening to her cry to get there! I was super upset and worried about her since I did not know what was wrong with her. The vet diagnosed her with Idiopathic Vestibular Disease, which is sort of a catch all for a few possible causes, inflammation in the brain, or inner ear infection or a brain tumor. They said the only way to tell if it was a brain tumor was with an MRI, which they don't really recommend as a first step. They suggested trying antibiotics first to see if there was any improvement and hope that it was not a brain tumor! We got antibiotics and came home. Baby Kitty had to spend a week in our bathroom since she could not walk very well and I was concerned she would fall down the stairs! My oldest son had to give her the medicines twice a day while we were on Vacation too, so I was worried about him doing it right. Baby Kitty is doing much better, still a bit wobbly and has a slight head tilt still, so we will have to bring her back to the vet for a follow up.

We rode more than ten miles south through numerous towns and private roads along the nicely paved bike path, and then opted to stop at a local pizza place for a quick bite. To our surprise the garlic chips we ordered as a snack actually came out on a large tray, and it became clear this restaurant had a different name for their cheese bread. Both of us were shocked at first but ultimately happy with our delicious treat, which we devoured in a few minutes. Once we finished our drinks and paid our check, it was time to head back in the same direction we came to finish off our great bike trip.

Our decision to rent bikes also proved to be a great idea. We agreed it was the best way to explore such a great area that many people often speed right through with their car.
