I got it after the $1000 clunker I bought in high school died on me.  Having a mechanic glance at it would have cost more than it was worth. I went around looking for a newish used car, but I had bad credit from some delinquent bills from college.  Most places wouldn't finance a car without a HUGE down payment.  I was just out of college and had no money and only an entry-level job.  Billy Bob's Used Cars said that they would finance anyone.  The cars in Billy Bobs had the monthly payments stickered onto their windshields.  The prices were less than I'd seen elsewhere.  I was really stressed out about the whole situation.  I was stupid and I rushed through the whole process and didn't carefully read the sales contract.  In the fine print was a little mention of this thing called a \"balloon payment.\"  At the end of the loan, i was expected to pay a lump sum of $1200.  That was why the payments were so reasonable. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and the state Department of Consumer Affairs, but they both said that, while rare, car financing with a balloon payment was legal.  Just because the dealership failed to mention the final payment verbally doesn't mean that there's anything actionable in the agreement because there it was in writing.  I think the dealer and other dealers take advantage of the fact that some people just want to get the odious process over and done with as quickly as possible.  It is just an embarrassing episode that I don't like to talk about. I have better credit now, so my bank kindly gave me a loan on the equity of my now 6 year old car.  I really should have more closely read the sales agreement to begin with."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.  I ended up sleeping on the couches of friends and eventually, they got tired of me.  I got another greasy spoon job, but it didn't pay enough to afford rent, especially deposit and utilities.  I could have stayed at a cheap motel, but I figured I was better in the streets.  After being robbed a few times, and run off by cops, I decided to swallow my pride and go to a shelter.

About two hours into this, we decided to go to the grocery store and we bought a lot of snacks.  After six hours it was late night and we were wondering if the power would ever come back on.  We called the power company and they said it could be awhile.  We went to bed and hoped for the best.  We woke up the next morning to no power still.  The power company was now telling us the outages were so bad it could be up to a week for us to regain power.  We were new to the neighborhood and didnt really know anyone.  We were worried about hot water, food going bad, etc.  We went out for the say to forget about things.  When we returned there was a generator sitting on our driveway with a note attached.

I cut out things in my life that were holding me back, making me negative, or were not conducive to being my best self. I gave myself one month to go without social media, lustful thoughts, cussing, television, and sweets. It's definitely been a challenge! Since most people are on a health kick after the New Year, giving up sweets has been relatively easy, though I do sometimes miss having something sweet after dinner. Losing a few pounds has encouraged me to stick with the sweet dessert abstinence. The hardest thing has been giving up television. I have felt very out of touch with what's going on in the world. I also miss some of my favorite shows and find myself wondering if I will have trouble following the story arc once I start watching again. Social media has been surprisingly easy to give up. I guess that's because the negativity on there was really getting to me. I don't miss the drama or the rudeness. I have also found that by focusing my thoughts more positively and not swearing, cussing, or thinking lustful thoughts, I have more energy for creative thoughts. I've written two new poems and have a new story idea to write! Overall, the experience has been very rewarding.

It was by far the longest I've ever spent on a train, and I was super happy to finally get off in Denver, but the ride wasn't so bad. It's way more comfortable than flying because the seats are bigger, with lots of legroom and you can get up to walk around. They even have an observation car with giant windows, although it was usually crowded. Nobody was sitting next to me, so I had tons of room. And there was free wi-fi, so I watched Netflix and did all the normal things on my computer that I would have done if I was at home. All in all it was a pleasant ride. When I got to Denver, I had a few hours to kill before I could check into my hotel room. So I decided I would walk the 5 miles from the train station to the hotel. There just happened to be a nice bike/walking path along a creek that covered most of the distance. It wasn't in a hurry and it was a hot day, so I took my time. I saw lots of breaks to sit and watch the cyclists and joggers pass by. When I finally got to the hotel, I was pretty sweaty and red in the face, and I still had a little more time to kill. So I found a bathroom and freshened up and relaxed in the lounge for a bit. Then I checked in and went to my room. From a quick internet search I saw that there were about 5 dispensaries all within walking distance from my hotel and I could see 3 of them from my room. So I picked the one that had the best reputation and went to buy legal cannabis for the first time. When you first walk into the dispensary, it looks like a boring waiting room. You give your ID to someone and then they buzz you into the main room where everything is for sale. Then you assigned a \"budtender\" who helps you choose what you want to buy.

The first had a lot of medical issues that was a bit much for me  to handle so I did not meet her. The second was a couple of years older than I was anticipating but thought it would be nice to meet her. She was black with while socks and white tip on her tail, very pretty dog. I walked her around the yard and she was so sweet. She did everything I wanted to and seem to have the saddest eyes when she looked up at me. She is 7 years old and seemed to be healthy. She was born in Australia and was raced in China for many years. They closed the race track there and she was kept as one of 600 dogs with no where to go. The rescue group close to me heard of these dogs and was able to get 20 of them out of China. Of the 600 dogs, only 300 were made healthy enough to be rescued out of the country. I couldn't resist, I brought her home. That was 5 months ago. Since then she has become my constant companion. No matter what room I am in, she finds a spot to sit and watch me.

At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day.

This story is about the misadventures of our missing cat. Then I went outside one evening a few days later and Baby Kitty came stumbling out of the garage. She could not stand up at all and her head was tilted to the side. She seemed to be in a lot of distress about not standing up, so I grabbed the cat carrier and off we went to the Emergency Vet, since of course this happened after the normal vets are closed. The emergency vet is not really very close since we live in a rural area, so it took about a half hour of listening to her cry to get there! I was super upset and worried about her since I did not know what was wrong with her. The vet diagnosed her with Idiopathic Vestibular Disease, which is sort of a catch all for a few possible causes, inflammation in the brain, or inner ear infection or a brain tumor. They said the only way to tell if it was a brain tumor was with an MRI, which they don't really recommend as a first step. They suggested trying antibiotics first to see if there was any improvement and hope that it was not a brain tumor! We got antibiotics and came home. Baby Kitty had to spend a week in our bathroom since she could not walk very well and I was concerned she would fall down the stairs! My oldest son had to give her the medicines twice a day while we were on Vacation too, so I was worried about him doing it right. Baby Kitty is doing much better, still a bit wobbly and has a slight head tilt still, so we will have to bring her back to the vet for a follow up.

We rode more than ten miles south through numerous towns and private roads along the nicely paved bike path, and then opted to stop at a local pizza place for a quick bite. To our surprise the garlic chips we ordered as a snack actually came out on a large tray, and it became clear this restaurant had a different name for their cheese bread. Both of us were shocked at first but ultimately happy with our delicious treat, which we devoured in a few minutes. Once we finished our drinks and paid our check, it was time to head back in the same direction we came to finish off our great bike trip.

Our decision to rent bikes also proved to be a great idea. We agreed it was the best way to explore such a great area that many people often speed right through with their car.

It was unexpected but I thought this reflected well on my past performance as an employee. It appears that the organization is going through a restructure and my former employer thought my input and guidance would be useful during this challenging period. My former manager, who asked me to return as manager of a newly forming team, said he believed I would be a great asset in bringing old and new employees together to help drive the organization forward. He also said my old team had been affected by my retirement and their productivity was not quite as good as it had been under my leadership. Admittedly, I do miss my former colleagues and team but I do not miss the pressure of my former position and having new and harder targets to achieve on a regular basis - not only was it hard for me but even harder leading others to achieve. My former industry is becoming more and more competitive as new technologies are released and more talented people are attracted into the area. My former manager also offered me a significant pay rise and good bonus potential. I was very tempted by this offer especially as my 401k and social security could use the boost! That said there are many aspects of the job I don't want to repeat even with the temptation of potentially new ways of doing things. I was happy to retire as I was getting very tired and stressed by the demands of the organization and industry. I do not think I have the energy and ambition to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of the job. Still, the offer had me torn and I asked for a week to think things over. My former manager said that would be fine and he hoped I would return. During that week I called some former colleagues to find out what had been going on within the organization since I had retired. They all agreed, separately, that the industry has indeed become much more competitive and the organization was struggling to keep up, hence the restructure. Most commented that it had been and still was a difficult and stressful time. Some said they envied my retirement and wished they could do the same! The things my colleagues said helped me make up my mind to turn down the offer. I enjoy being retired too much to return to a highly stressful job.

I finally found a BMW 328i close enough to ride my bike to see. I contacted the seller and made plans to see it that Sunday. I had been withdrawing cash every week to be sure I had enough to buy a car when I found one but I needed enough money in my bank account to cover the cost of insurance so I'd be able to drive it home. On Thursday I made certain to transfer the funds I needed well before the cutoff time. A little while later I got an email that the transfer failed. I found a reddit thread stating others were having the same problem. The withdrawal had to be done before about 5:00 or I knew it wouldn't be in my account. I tried throughout the day every 30 to 45 minutes or so hoping it would work. finally just before 4:30 the transfer finally went through. On Friday I checked my balance and found that instead of depositing my withdrawal once I had every single attempted withdrawal deposited to my account. I wasn't sure what to do since I now had over 400 extra dollars in my account and a negative balance in my Amazon payments account. I didn't know when the money might be taken out or whether they would only take the extra money or reverse it all and correct it with another deposit. The advice I kept getting was to not touch the money until it was figured out. I felt like I was in limbo and was extremely frustrated. I contacted the seller and told him I wouldn't be able to meet Sunday but if he still had it next weekend I would come get it. After a few days I finally received an email from Amazon confirming the error and that funds would not be removed from anyone's bank account. Unfortunately they weren't clear about what would happen to our Amazon payments account. I confirmed with the seller I would be able to come see the car that weekend and we set a time. One day I found the car was no longer listed and asked if it was sold. The seller replied that he had a flat tire he wasn't able to change and found the car had been towed from the apartment building he parked it at. My heart sank I felt a great opportunity had slipped out of my hands due to bad luck and felt a little bit hopeless about finding a vehicle. Amazon sent an email on Thursday stating the incorrect balance had been resolved and that the extra funds were ours to keep as an apology for the inconvenience I was completely floored that I just got a gift of over $400. A few days later I found a 525i that was listed for only a couple hundred more than the one I was planning to buy and it was a newer model by four years plus the interior looked new and the body was in pretty good condition with no major issues. After checking it over and test driving it I wound up negotiating with the guy for 100 less than the car I was previously going to buy so I wound up with $400 extra dollars and a car that was one model range up and four years newer for less money."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

We planned on living there for a bit, saving a bunch of money, and doing other things like travel and a search for long term housing options in the meantime.

The next day, a young woman who had recently moved into our complex was having a party outside. 1 of her male friends came to visit and partake in the party. He offered my wife and I a place to park a travel trailer on his lot, for incredibly cheap and also have access to a house. This is where everything started to go downhill.

We have full access to a home, our trailer, and now a yard. I slowly but surely start to see my wife starting to form an emotional affair right before my eyes with the male roommate. We were in a bit of a rough patch, but nothing unworkable in my eyes.

In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments.

As you know I've been staying with my parents and starting to save up money. This was because they told me they plan to move to Texas next year. That's fine, it gives me plenty of time to get caught up, get my finances in order and find a place to move to because I have no intention on moving to Texas with them. That's just too fa away from my current life and I'm not willing to just start over yet. Now here comes the part that just left me angry and jaded for a very long time. About 2 months ago they (and by they I mean my mother and my dad didn't stop her) decided to move the move date up to June 15th. That means my timeline for saving money went from having 8 months and magically dropped down to about a month and a half. Needless to say I was livid. I started to work as much overtime and stay up late hours doing additional work at home because I was in full panic mode and I couldn't afford to not be working around the clock. Now, we get to a few days before June 15th, she's rushing me to get packed and moved out so I disused moving in with one of my friends and he agreed. The 14th we move everything over there and I'm basically done. Still really mad but relieved to have the situation behind me. But it doesn't end there... in all that rushing and we're moving now and you have to go they neglected to tell me something. It turned out that the 15th was NOT when I had to leave. They ended up staying in the house for an entire extra month before they finally moved out and headed to Texas.  I was so mad when one of them said \"No son, we're still here\" I almost hung up the phone immediately. To this day I'm still salty about the whole thing but I've at least gotten over it for the most part. I do miss them a lot and have warmed up to calling them again.

I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone.

These tasks can be walking, running, backing up, or turning the horse. Whenever a rider is showing their horse, the stay on the opposite side of the judge, so they are not in the way. Roping is when you have the rider behind a locked gate. A person at another gate releases an animal, usually a calf. The rider rides in to throw a rope around the calf's neck. If the rider is successful, they are timed. The times are ranked. The person with the best time wins that round. Next, Reigning is when a rider comes in riding their horse. The horse and rider are challenged with several different tasks, many which consist of spinning. Spinning is making tight circles while going as fast as the rider can.

For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting.

He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath.  I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder.

It didn't matter who did it, how it happened, the fact that Katie was in another state at the time -- the entire family, including her two sisters, would gang up and yell at her. So Katie's sister, Krystal, is getting married into a conservative Greek Orthodox family. She's losing her mind because she wants so bad for her new family to think she's perfect, which is laughable, but whatever. Of course, the morning of the wedding, everything is going wrong and how dare Katie do this, despite the fact that Katie wasn't even awake when everything started happening. Makeup if misplaced, boxes haven't been taken up to the church for decorating, the works. So they all load up and head to the church to get the place ready. Katie grabs a box nearly as big as her hauls it into the church, and asks Krystal where it needs to go, to which she responds, \"OH MY GOD KATIE JUST SET IT DOWN SOMEWHERE!\"Katie, being the sweetheart she is, sets it down somewhere out of the way so people won't trip on it, but still in a higher traffic area so it can be found. She goes to put on her dress because some of the groomsmen are putting up the decorations. Of course, Krystal screeches like a banshee not ten minutes later because something in the box Katie had carried in needed refrigeration, but Katie was not informed of that. Not only was it not in the refrigerator, but Katie cleary hid it so nobody else could find it because she was trying to ruin the wedding. Katie apologizes and shows her where the box is. Katie will hold Krystal's bouquet (the other sister couldn't do it for whatever reason -- it was probably too heavy for her poor, dainty arms). So Katie verifies how that's going to work. \"So you give it to me, there's some talking, you and Carl walk around the altar a few times, then I give it back to you?\" Krystal doesn't answer, and after a few more questions, she dismissively says, \"yeah, yeah, you give it back to me.\"During the ceremony, Krystal never makes a move to take the bouquet back, and does not accept it when offered. Katie is yelled at about this after the ceremony. Then they get in a huge fight, katie was so angry, she was crying.

Now I was on full tilt, frustrated with my enormous losses. Instead of walking out, I decided to make a withdraw of another 1500. Down another 500, I decide to try one more machine. After a few spins, I hit the bonus playing at 20 a spin. The bonus game is pretty unique with the multiplier of win line hits goes up after every free game. The thing that happened was when there was a 7x multiplier, I had a line hit for over 7000!! The bonus ended with almost winning 9500 which is my biggest jackpot every. I was very emotional, with shock and disbelief of what occurred. This was a gift, as it helped me pay down a lot of debt.

So I know it has been a while since I have written in you but I just wanted to keep you updated. About a month ago I woke up with some pretty bad tooth pain. Most of the morning I was in pain and finnaly ended up calling the doctor about it. They told me I should call my dentist as there was nothing they could do. So I call them and they told me that I had to wait until the next day in order to even see them. I tried taking pain meds and orajel and it did help a little bit but not as much as I hoped. So the next morning came around and I finnaly went there and the told me I needed a root canal! I was pretty nervous that it would hurt quite a bit but I knew in the long run it would be better for my teeth. So after about a 15 minute procedure it was all over. They were nice for the most part but boy did it hurt quite a bit. I would say after about 15 minutes it started to hurt worse but they did give me much better pain pills to deal with it. Later that night I was starting to feel a bit better. When I work up in the morning I was pain free and it was great.

I was alone in a remote area of northern Wyoming and heard a terrifying sound at about 3AM.  I had intended to camp at a developed site next to a lake because it was bear country and there were bear-proof storage boxes at the campsites.  When I arrived at the lake I was disappointed in the area, there was nobody there (it was a weekday) but it was obviously heavily used and a bit dumpy.  I decided to ride further down the dirt road to see what else there might be.  I came across a trail and after a mile or so there was a small clearing in the trees.  I thought that it would make a suitable site to set up the tent.  It was a bit eerie - there were forest fires in the region and the sky was reddish from the smoke, there was also Spanish moss hanging from the tree branches which added to the creepy atmosphere.  At any rate, I made dinner, enjoyed a beer and went to sleep at about 11PM.  I was awakened by a piercing scream at around 3AM, it was absolutely terrifying and I had never heard anything like it before.  All that came to mind at the time was that there was a large bird like a eagle outside the tent screeching at something.  As I listened I could hear it walking around the tent about 100' away, there were small branches breaking under it's feet as it walked along... whatever it was it seemed pretty big.  I was too scared to open the zipper and look outside the tent, I didn't want to draw attention to myself and have to deal with this thing up close.  After over an hour the sounds became more and more faint and I eventually drifted to sleep.  In the morning I examined the ground where I had imagined it had been walking.  I found some very clear large paw prints - it was a mountain lion!  I have never seen a mountain lion in the wild, and the sound that it was making that night was otherworldly, something I'll never forget."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

To celebrate and mark the occasion my grown son took me to Walt Disney World for a week long vacation. I had never been to Disney World and, being a lifetime fan of Disneyland, having the chance to experience this park with my son was a dream come true. I had become very ill nine years ago and nearly lost my life to liver and heart failure. The illness came out of the blue and remains an unknown etiology as far as my physician is concerned. My recovery and transformation has been time consuming and come with many changes to my life, abilities, and career. My son walked along my side during my illness and knew that reaching a point where I could travel with him would be the best reward I could hope for. Our vacation was amazing from the moment we reached Florida and boarded the Disney bus. Our resort hotel was absolutely beautiful and the parks were amazing. Animal Kingdom was by far our favorite resort with Epcot a close second. My son had been very careful to book all of our dining reservations with my needs in mind. A chef came to our table to ask me about my dietary restrictions and made beautiful meals for me. We even had a refrigerator and microwave in our room so I could prepare my own breakfast each day. We both agreed that Disneyland still outshines any theme park and will be our family favorite. I rarely spend long periods of time with my son since he is 32, very busy in his career, and travels the world for business.

We're going for lunch when we get in, I've heard a popular vegetarian restaurant El Piano is due to close soon so we're going to check that out. Then we're going for a wander - if it's sunny we'll walk the city walls as that's an easy way to take in the sights. We'll be drinking after that though - York has enough bars and pubs to visit a new one every day of the year! We'll probably start on Stonegate, at Evil Eye, as they do amazing cocktails. Then it's just a case of seeing where we fancy - there's no point going with much of a plan as York is very popular for Hen and Stag Do's, so it could be really busy. If we head home about 8 we think we can miss the Saturday night rush at least, and hopefully avoid much of a hangover the next day! "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}
