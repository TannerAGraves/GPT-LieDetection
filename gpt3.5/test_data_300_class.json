{"text":"Over the past year I have been involved with a court situation involving my daughter and my granddaughter. Unfortunately she hasn't been able to care for her in the right way, due to mental health issues. This resulted  in my granddaughter's removal from my daughter's home. My granddaughter was placed in my temporary care for the past 12 months. I have tried over the last year to work on building a trusting relationship with my daughter and work with her to make sure she is seeing her daughter often. We have gone to family therapy and learned to communicate more effectively. There had been many times where this was painful to watch my daughter have emotions of loss and try to convince her that I had to look out for my granddaughter as well. As part of the court proposal they suggested I become guardian. My daughter was not willing to agree to this. This would mean there was a chance my granddaughter could be put into the foster system. We had court on May 7th the day before my 49th birthday.  I was sure my daughter would not agree to guardianship. When the lawyers went in front of the judge my daughter had agreed that she would allow me to have guardianship. This was emotional because I felt sad for my daughter that she knew she would not get her daughter back if had gone to trial. On the other hand I felt a great relief that my daughter trusts me enough that I will make sure she has as much time with her daughter to keep their relationship alive in the hopes that some day she will be able to have her back.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"text":"It's the day after my 23rd birthday and I can remember just enough to know I had a great time. That's how it should be, in my mind. I wanted to celebrate the 23rd year of my life with a bang. Lucky for me I have a few co workers who are around my age. They knew my birthday was coming up and asked if I was doing anything special. I told them I had some vague plans, nothing specific. One of them made a comment that we should all go out after work to celebrate. He's always telling these elaborate stories about his night time adventures so I thought it might make for a great birthday memory. I agreed and we made plans. The day arrived and I was pretty excited. My colleagues also seemed ready to go. Turns out I was not prepared for what was to come! From what I can remember, there was a lot of drinking, strippers and some unflattering selfies involved. We took an Uber into the city and that's the last of my clear recollection. We definitely went pretty hard, but it was a great time overall.","label":0,"set":"B"}

They acted cold and callous towards me for no reason, and they were talking silently among themselves. it was very rude. I felt awkward and decided to get out of there. I texted my friend and told him to call me and act like it was an emergency so i could bail out. He came through and it worked. My girlfriend bought it and we left.

I went to get my tux but still couldn't believe the reason I was getting a tux. I just could have never imagined it. The wedding day came and it was one of the most beautiful setups I had ever seen. There were so many combinations of colors and decorations everywhere and his and his wife seemed so happy. The wedding ceremony went as planned and we made our way to the cars to go to the reception. At the reception he asked me to speak, which I did because I know he would do the same for me. I told a few jokes, everyone laughed and we all ate and had good conversations. At the end of the day my best friend and I talked for a while in private and I told him I was proud of him. He motivated me to want to do the same thing one day. I handed him some money and told him to make sure he spends it wisely. He smiled, nodded, and agreed to do so. We went back to the reception (from speaking in private) and helped clean up a little bit. It was a very good day from not only him, but me too.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"text":"Several months ago myself along with several others flew to Oregon to backpack along the PCT, the Pacific Coast Trail. We had all just turned 18 and were looking for something to together before we all left for university. The PCT is over 2000 miles long stretching from Canada all the way to Mexico and takes at least 6 months to complete. Our goal was to complete the Oregon section and backpack all the way across Oregon into Washington in 3 weeks or less. We grossly underestimated our task. Our first challenge arose just minutes after landing in the small municipal airport 30 minutes from the trail head. We needed to find someone to drive us to the trail head before nightfall, which was quickly approaching. We found someone willing to take the 6 of us in a minivan the 30 minutes to the trail head. The unfortunate part was that our driver had no idea where the trail start was - and neither did we. He ended up dropping us off on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere, just an hour before sunset. What we had though was the start to the trail ended up being just a game trail. We were lost in a foreign state, in the middle of nowhere with no signal to use GPS, the sun setting behind us. So we picked a direction and started walking down the gravel road. Several miles later of the same landscape along with the now high moon lighting the road, we flagged down a passing truck, the first person we had seen in hours. We explained to him what we were doing and that we were lost, he told us to keep walking down the road and we will eventually find a sheriffs station who can help us out. He also made sure to remind us of the impossibility of our goal and that we should just go home. Later in the night, closer to 1 am we came across a group of rangers performing a search and rescue, we again explain our situation and after their several minutes of amusement at our situation they tell us that the trail is less than a mile up a nearby path. They kindly give us some food and water along with a map and send us on our way. We reached the trail head that night and went on to complete the rest of the Oregon section within 3 weeks - probably to the surprise of the man in his truck. There were many other adventures and memories had within that time, but that is for another essay.","label":1,"set":"B"}

He was so upset with me he decided to call child protective services on me. I'm a good mother and he had nothing to fault me with so he made something up. He told thm I neglect her, she didn't have any clothes, and I have untreated postpartum depression, none of which was true. CPS actually came to my home to interview me. They even went to my daughter's school to question her. It was the most upset and embarassed I've ever been in my life. She said she felt embarassed and afraid of these people in suits who pulled her out of class. He put my daughter at risk of being taken away from me as well as caused her mental trauma. But I believe karma has intervened. He was just involved in a huge car accident. His car was totaled and the accident was his fault. He was injured and had to go to the hospital and miss days of work while he recovered. So I definitely believe karma comes back to haunt those who do others wrong. I didn't retaliate but I didn't have to because he got what he deserved.","label":0,"set":"B"}

They decided to meet the following night at a small diner on the corner. While my grandmother was afraid to inform her father of this date she went ahead and told her parents.

So I wasn't pursuing things with her at the time. My girlfriend at the time was no longer coming around and I felt our relationship was near ended. I failed to try to address this and communicate with her. I started talking to a new girl a few days before my birthday, and we really clicked.

I told her when we first started talking that I was polyamarous and had other girls in my life. However once things got intense it became very clear that she was looking for a monogamous relationship. I wanted her so bad. My needs weren't being met by my girlfriend. The other girl, our conversations were good but, not nearly as intense. The night before my birthday I broke up with my girlfriend so that I could get to know the new girl. I broke my girlfriends heart. She cried. But she said she was proud of me for taking a risk and would be there for me. I also told the other girl what I had done and what I was pursuing. She immediately distanced herself from me and it seems I broke her heart too. I met the new girl a few days later and afterwards she stopped texting me completely and told me she wasn't interested.

{"text":"Last February my wife found out she had cancer. The cancer was in an area that could not be operated on so her only options were chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Since she already suffers from Fibromyalgia we knew it was going to be very hard on her. On the first day of radiation the doctor decided to wait a few days to start the chemo treatment as both in one day would be too much for her. When the day came we went to the infusion center and she was hooked up for about 4 hours but had to take a chemo bag with her that pumped the chemicals into her body 24 hours per day. She started on a Monday and by Wednesday she was so sick she couldn't get out of bed. As the day progressed she started getting confused and couldn't even finish a sentence. I decided she had to go to the hospital and I thought I could help her out of bed and downstairs and into the car but I found that she was in so much pain I couldn't touch her anywhere without her screaming. I called 911 for an ambulance and while waiting for them her condition worsened. They arrived in about 10 minutes and I tried to move as many things out of the way as I could so they could get the gurney down our two half flights of stairs. There were 4 of them and it took all of us to get her on the gurney, because she was screaming in pain and delirious. I was trying to stay calm but this all happened so suddenly I completely forgot about our little girl. I had block her off in the den while the paramedics were there as that was the first thing they requested so no animals would be in the way or get hurt. Once they had her in the ambulance they asked where I wanted her to be taken and if I needed to ride in the front of the ambulance. There said insurance restrictions prevented me from riding in the back with her. I said I would follow them in my car, not knowing how long I would be there. As they drove away I thought of all the things I had to do while at the same time thinking and worrying about my wife. A neighbor who I did not know and who lives 2 doors away was standing outside watching. For a brief second I was a bit annoyed at them watching a \"show\" and I was becoming a bir frantic trying to figure out everything I had to do even before getting in my car and driving to the hospital so I could be with my sweetheart. I heard this soft voice saying \"sir\", \"sir\" and I turned around to see this neighbor trying to get my attention. I thought she might want to know what was going on but she softly said \"if there's anything I can do for you let me know\". I asked her if there was any way she could watch our 4 month old puppy and she said she would be glad to. I quickly brought her kennel and food over, locked the house and drove to the hospital, calling everyone that needed to be told , on the way.

When I finally arrived in Tokyo for the first time, it felt as if I was in another planet. Everything was completely different. The people looked different, they spoke a different language , the architecture was completely different.  It was like a different world. I was so excited and I felt more alive than I ever had before. I was picked up at the airport by the family I was staying with and while I was very nervous at first I eventually got more confidence in myself when talking to them. They were very kind, friendly and they treated me like a family member. When I arrived at their house, it was more tiny than I expected, but I really loved the feel of it. It had a lot of Japanese traditional rooms including a tatami room which I really loved. The family took me around Japan to a lot of different cities and towns including Kyoto, Tokyo, Saitama, and we even flew to Okinawa as well. I really admire how clean the cities are in Japan and how polite people are. They are very friendly and helpful to foreigners.

{"text":"One major event in my life is that in the past 6 months, I moved to somewhere entirely new, and got a job, and started a whole different life for me. I moved from my parents house and packed up all my belongings over the course of a week or so, then my girlfriend drove down from Northern Maine(I lived in Mass). We loaded up her car and mine, and began the 7 hour drive to our new place. After several weeks of preparation, organizing everything and getting stuff set up and purchased how we would need them, we were finally ready for this huge transition. In the coming weeks after that long drive, we unpacked everything and set up our new place how we wanted it. There was a lot of frustration and sweat and swearing as we struggled to shift furniture around the apartment, but we managed. Then some weeks later, I managed to find a job in a medical office. A position I took to readily and have since been excelling at. The actual act of moving was a stressful one, we spent a lot of time worrying ourselves over money, over my ability to find a job, over how I\"d manage to work out my schooling, all of it. Not to mention the fact that my family strongly disapproved of the decision and began treating me incredibly poorly once I broke the news to them. We drove for several hours before making our first stop, me trailing behind her, as her car was larger and she had packed it up to the point where she couldn't really see behind her. We stopped to pick up something to drink and use the restroom, as well as refuel our cars. THe drive was one we'd made many times before so the actual act of driving wasn't too bad, however, it was somewhat exhausting for her since she made the drive down just the day prior. With the cars refueled we went a ways further, before stopping for some Burger King. The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, and we stopped first at our new apartment to drop off some of the stuff. However, since we got in at around 10pm, we were too tired to really move everything in in earnest, so we went to her parent's house to sleep. Bright and early the next day, we began the long process of moving my stuff, as well as hers, into our new place. Hours upon hours of moving stuff, lifting it up stairs, shifting it around, just general struggle. But ultimately, we have our place exactly how we want it, and I loved the experience.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"text":"When I was eight years old, about 22 months ago, my dad started to hit me. The most memorable part of this is the way he acted after the abuse each time. He would apologize like he had done something minor, like forgetting to read me a bedtime story. He just acted like what happened was something that he could apologize and move on from. I will never forget the way he dismissed his own behavior. However, his behavior ended up ruining mine and my siblings' lives. I fear that if I ever see him again or that if he has more children in the future, the abuse will continue once more. I hope that he does not remarry a woman that has children of her own as well. I fear that if he becomes involved with a wife or other children, he will abuse them as well. The abuse has been significant to my life because it has led to a chain of events that have landed me in foster care. After a teacher noticed the bruises, she told officials. Officials investigated the situation of my home life and immediately determined that I was not safe at home with my father. Since my mother is not in the picture, I was placed immediately into foster care. This did not only affect me, however. My siblings were abused and place into foster care as well. We were placed with different foster families and I have not seen my sibling since. I miss my siblings, and as much as my home was an unhappy place, I miss having a home to call my own. I feel that I have no one in the world that truly knows me or that I can depend on. I just feel very alone. It is hard for me to talk about anyone about this since it is a very personal experience that only a few other that have been through it can understand. It helps a little bit to write out my feelings in this diary, but it is not the same as talking to a trusted person that understands how I feel. The actions of my father have changed my life for the worse. I have lost my family and my home. I do not feel safe anymore since he started abusing me and my siblings. It effected me physically during the actual abuse, but it will effect me mentally for the rest of my life.","label":0,"set":"B"}
{"text":"About a year and a half ago, i gave birth to my last son. I have decided to not have any more children since then. However, that day was a day that truly changed my life forever. I remember that the night before i had gone to the hospital for having contractions. They told me i was in active labor and that they were going to admit me. Then, about an hour later, the contractions had slowed, so they decided to let me go home for the night. I thought that was ridiculous, but i left. While i was at home, i was not able to sleep or even stand comfortably. The next morning, I was still awake from the night before, crying due to the contractions. I was rushed to the hospital when i absolutely couldn't bare the pain anymore. Once i was there, my son was born no more than an hour and a half later. It was the first birth where i had my family with me. My other two sons were born out of state. It was very memorable and exciting to have all the love and support in the room. A day i will never ever forget.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago we decided to go to the apple orchard. The day was bright and sunny but felt chilly for summer. We went planning to see the animals, pick apples, ride the wagon. This year they added a big jump pad for the kids to play in! When we go there we played in the little wood houses they have first, then went to the yearly wagon ride! On the wagon ride the guide told us all about the farm and how much water it takes, how many apples they produce, and all sorts of information. After the wagon ride we were able to get lost in the corn maze, they added fun trivia to help point you in the right way this year. Then at the exit we were able to jump on the giant pumpkin pad. We of course gathered a bag of apple to bring home. The kids loved eating the fresh apples instead of bagging them. The little one was able to ride around on my solders while we walked around eating our apples. They also took away the pedal bike races and replaced it with a mine shaft play area where you could purchase bags of sand with gems. To finish up our day we looks at the animals, we saw little pigs, lamas, goats, and lots of other farm animals. We will probably be back again in the next couple weeks to go play for a while. I can not wait to go next year and see what else they add!","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"text":"Today I quit my job in order to retire.  I was not entirely happy about it, but it was time.  I wish I had left a better feeling at work with Stephanie, but aside from that, it was basically a good experience.  Tim said \"Good luck, Mike\" when I cleaned out my desk.  I gave Chris my tissues and a fistful of red pens.  Since Chris has severe allergies, this small gift was appreciated.  I gave Rachael an unfinished buyback, but luckily she appreciated the humor.  I loaded up Smiley, my Mexican sugar skull, and Jules, my turtle.  I put the box in the car and took a deep breath.  The weather was nice and sunny.  I did feel a sense of relief as I drove away.  I would never have to go there again!  There were money worries, of course.  But I have plenty saved.  Also, Kathy is still working, so that will help.  And I can devote myself to the kids.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"text":"I met him before my freshman year of college, at a camp for incoming students. He was in my small group, but I didn't originally think anything of him. He tried to get together a few times freshman year, but I always blew him off. I didn't think we had anything in common. Eventually we became friends. He was there for me when I was going through difficult times. We became best friends. Eventually, he came and visited me. We did regular things, like going to ikea. However, I eventually realized I was developing romantic feelings for him. I knew that he would never make the first move, so I had to. I kissed him out of nowhere, and told him how I felt. He felt the same way and we started dating. Our relationship is great. That's how I fell in love with my best friend.","label":1,"set":"B"}
