We wanted to keep our family together, so we all moved together, my husband, me, and our two children who are also in elementary school. I decided that for awhile I will be a stay at home mom and take care of our two boys while they are in their younger years. I think my teaching background will help with this and make it a good experience for them. I was very sad to leave my job because I love my coworkers and students. My students have always been great, and they gave me little cards that they made to wish me good luck in the future and told me that they will miss me. At the same time, I think there will be an opportunity for me in the future to become principal of a local school in our new area. I had thought about moving up like this for awhile and might have the opportunity a few years down the road. I have enrolled in a graduate program to prepare me for this next step in my journey and will be able to dedicate more time to it since I will be staying at home with the kids and will have some time during the day while they are at school. It was difficult for me to leave everything I knew and the city I grew up in to move away with my husband, but I think it will also open new doors and new opportunities for me. I have needed a little push to get me going in the direction I want to be going, and this might help me take the leap and go the next step in my career. My husband is very happy about his promotion and transfer, and I think this will end up being a promotion for me as well. My students and I all took a picture on my last day and I have it framed in our new house. It was hard and tear-filled when I had to say goodbye to my colleagues and leave the building with a box of my stuff. Most surprising to me has been that several of my students parents have reached out to me on social media, so I think that will be a nice way to keep in touch with my roots and not completely lose touch with my home town. I have become friends with one parent in particular who I always viewed as a difficult parent, but she is very well-meaning and wants the best for her children and I have a completely different view of her now that we are friends and not just seeing each other in parent-teacher meetings. It is interesting to see different sides of people and see things you didn't think you would see. The other thing that was difficult for me was that our new town is smaller than our old one and it seems a little bit more difficult to meet people but I am hoping that being in school will help with that, and I might try to start some social groups, which is something I had always thought about doing.

I was hoping you would reassure me that I wouldn't be. Instead, you took my silence as an affirmation that I would be better off. You went to work and I went on with my day as normal. Little did I know that everything had changed. Days later, I tried to reconnect and work on the relationship, but you were no longer interested. It hurt me tremendously. I was counting on you for years, and despite all our problems, I was still trying to fix things. Used to our fights, I expected things to fall back into place in the next few weeks, since we could never stay away from each other for too long. That never happened. I reluctantly began going on dates with other people to try to move on and heal from your rejection, and you took that as a sign that I was seeking something or something else. I didn't know what else to do to try to fix something you didn't want anymore. Months later, we remain separated and rarely talk. It's still unbelievable to me because I never imagined we could go longer than a day without taking to each other. I have yet to tell my parents that it ended. I think that's because part of me is still holding on to hope that we'll work out. However, I'm simultaneously starting to accept that things are this way. Even though I still miss you, I no longer have the desire to tell you about everything that happens in my life. I no longer have the urge to talk to you all the time or think about you constantly. It's unfamiliar, but I guess this is what you wanted. I don't know the details of your life anymore and that's ok. In the end, I just hope we're both happy wherever we end up. I just never would have imagined it ending this way.","label":1,"set":"B"}

It made me feel special and made me think, it would be good to get the family together. Maybe it would help us each heal a little faster, having each other there for support. My family could see how much I was struggling, as they were, but they also helped me out financially and that made me feel really loved. When we had the party, I cried the morning of it. But then when everyone showed up, I felt great. I was relieved that I had family around. We ate cake and food and they sang to me. I opened up some nice presents, and one of them was a photo album with a lot of photos of all of us family members with my mom. We all cried together, but they were happy cries.

{"index":3608,"Unnamed: 0":3608,"text":"It has been a decidedly difficult year for me. At the beginning of the year, my depression crashed into me like waves against an island shore during a storm. Even though mental illness is becoming less of a taboo subject in society, it still remains very stigmatized. In an effort to not scare my loved ones, I kept it mostly hidden from them. It took a large amount of effort to simply maintain my head above the water, and then something happened that would send me plummeting back into that murky, endless darkness. My grandfather died. It wasn't a necessarily unexpected death in the family. He was aging and had a string of visits to the hospital, which I'm sure added to the overwhelming amount of stress onto my mom's plate. Her father was important to her, anyone who saw them interact knew as much. Nonetheless, nothing really prepares you for the death of a loved one. Even more so if you haven't had the opportunity to see them in a very long time. Maybe that is why it hit me so hard, maybe it was the guilt from knowing he desperately wanted to see me and yet I couldn't find the time. It is something I wholly regret, and while everyone around me can tell me that surely he knew I loved him and to not beat myself up, I can't shake the feeling of remorse. I should have made the time, I should have had that one moment with him before I never would be able to again. Now I have only his tombstone to talk to, and as an Atheist, I think it makes it all that much more depressing. If there is no life after death, it means that this is it -- it is all I have left of him: fond memories and a tombstone.","label":1,"set":"B"}

{"index":4059,"Unnamed: 0":4059,"text":"About five months ago, I decided to become a court appointed special advocate. CASA for short. I really love children, and with my background in pediatric nursing, I thought I would do a good job representing the abused and unloved ones in court. Well, as it happens, I did too good a job. My first child to represent was a four year old girl who had been physically abused by her drug addicted parents. My heart went out to this beautiful child, and I just resented her parents so much. I really bonded with her when we were meeting prior to the court date. Even though she is only four, I really could feel her emotional pain and despair from being raised by parents who loved drugs more than her. I spoke for her at the custody trial in which I was attempting to get her away from her parents and into foster care. I guess I really was able to let the judge understand the girl's despair and unending pain she suffers in her home, because the judge did take the child away from her parents. He granted custody to me. The judge said that it was clear the child had emotional and behavioral issues, and also clear that she had formed a strong bond with me. I was to be her foster parent. I was in total shock. I am glad to be an advocate, but honestly just want to focus on my career, and have no intention of having children right now. I guess God has other plans, though, because the girl went home with me that day after court. She and I have been living together for about 3 months now, and I am loving every minute of it. Every day, I feel like I learn something new about being a parent and a friend. I am able to see this child blossom into a beautiful healthy, well adjusted child, and I know I am the reason for that. I have found that I love her more than I thought I could, and she is really the one that has saved me.","label":0,"set":"B"}

{"index":7677,"Unnamed: 0":7677,"text":"About a month ago I decided to go on a road trip to the Niagara Falls and Toronto in general in Canada, I was driving from Kentucky, so it was a relatively descent little drive from my place to Toronto.  I decided to go all out when I got up there, since there was plenty of things to do I took my time and truly explored the region of Toronto in general.  The falls were truly breathtaking, and the water was quite cold since it was still winter time when I went.  Once I had my fill of the Falls I also checked out the Chinese cuisines that Toronto had to offer, and I was not disappointed, the food was truly amazing.  The vegetables were fresh, and crisp, while the rice was truly perfect, not too hard, and not too soft, but a good balance of firmness.  I also decided to see the CN tower, and was truly mesmerized by the sheer size of that structure, especially since it was right there, in downtown Toronto.  The sunset was also breathtaking and beautiful, but I don't think that is a strong enough word for how magnificent the sunset truly was.  I loved the trip because I do love exploring and just getting out and doing something different, exploring places I've never been before, and seeing the sheer beauty and raw power of nature, like the Falls provide.  The Chinese food was quite exquisite, as was the CN tower.   I would definitely recommend a trip like this one to my friends because it was such a nice place to go and see.  I think seeing the Falls and the CN tower should be on anyone's bucket list because of just how surreal the tower was, and how serene the Falls were, with that power, and sound of all of the water rushing.  The drive was a little bit rough from Kentucky, since the traffic also isn't kind once I got to Cincinnati, and then from there it just seemed to pick up more when I got up to Toledo and into Detroit.  I think it took me about 14 hours to drive up, I didn't stay at a hotel or anything, although I did take some pit stops to get food, fuel, and other various supplies.  I think I liked seeing the CN tower most, just because of how staggering it looks, right there in downtown Toronto, and also it's proximity to the rest of the city made it a very convenient place to visit while being close to the hotel and restaurants.  The Falls were a little bit far from the city, but not bad.  In closing, I'd like to say that this trip opened my eyes to what North America has to offer in general, and also what our northern neighbors have to offer also in terms of natural and man-made beauty.","label":0,"set":"B"}

Aso the first time I've ever fallen so hard while skiing. I've been skiing for over 40 years, and I was on a relatively mild slope. In fact, I was near the bottom of a relatively mild slope when I noticed a large rut in the snow that I couldn't avoid. I fell forward, and landed on my left shoulder and left side of my head. Fortunately, I was wearing a helmet, and did not suffer a concussion. I was able to make it back to my car, get out of my ski equipment, and drive myself to the emergency room. Sure enough, X-rays showed a broken left clavicle. With such a break, it is not possible to put it in a cast, so I had it in a soft sling for 3 weeks. After that, I just had to let it heal naturally, which took almost 4 months. I am a pretty active person, so it was rough getting use to not being able to do all the physical sports I enjoy.  I play pickleball 3 times a week, and I had to stop while I was healing. I also had a tough time sleeping for the first month, as it hurt every time I rolled over.

After that day I really learned to appreciate my friends more, no one has ever done anything like that for me. I guess I owe them on their birthdays!!","label":0,"set":"B"}

{"index":9664,"Unnamed: 0":9664,"text":"I don't remember the exact date when this happened, but it was within the last couple weeks. For the past year I've been trying out various Buddhist practices - particularly a lot of different meditation techniques. Sitting meditation can cause a lot of pain to arise in the body for me, and instead of working through that like I should, I've started to do a lot of walking meditation instead. This of course leads to its own types of pain, but they're more manageable. Anyway, recently I had been doing my walking meditation as usual. I like to do an hour a day whenever I can since I work from home and can leave my computer for short times here and there. I usually break this down into 10-15 minute sessions just to make it easier to get the practice in without disturbing my work day too much. One late afternoon\/early evening I was doing my walking and reached a very peaceful and tranquil state. My mind was significantly more quiet than it usually is, although there were still thoughts bubbling up here and there. I also realized at the time that the movement in my mind was starting to slow down. My mind was no longer jumping from one thought to another endlessly. This mental state continued for a few minutes as I continued to pace back and forth on my walking path and just observed it. After I finished that feeling of peace and tranquility lingered for a while before fading away. I've had some pretty strange and interesting experiences so far while exploring these different techniques. The stillness I felt during this particular session really stood out to me though.","label":1,"set":"B"}

Indy, who we rescued when she was just a few months old, was turning 13 this year. She'd suffered from a tumor that was growing larger every year. She was still a happy dog and wiggled her little stubby tail a million miles an hour whenever you'd notice her. A few months ago, she got sick and despite our best efforts, she passed away. We were able to keep her at home, she suffered from anxiety and hated to be separated from her family. We were all able to say our goodbyes and spend time with her before she passed. We buried her in our backyard, made a nice place for her to rest in peace. She brought so much love and joy into our lives and was a special dog. She was stubborn and had a weakness for chicken and just made you smile when her whole body wiggled with joy. Saying goodbye is never easy. Watching her give a last few wiggles of her tail despite being so weak but letting you know she still heard you talking to her was both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I was there as she breathed her last. I sat with her for a while hating to say goodbye and not really ever ready to let her go, but knowing that it was time. My heart still hurts when I think about her, but I also smile remembering all the wonderful memories I have of times spent with her.

Some of them have months of recovery already, some have a few days, but it's always unique. Each person comes in with their own personalities, pasts, goals, strengths & weaknesses. A couple months ago someone who has worked with our house before had recommended a new guy to me. He explained to me that he was struggling in another house with other guys harassing him and making it hard for him to sleep. I took this new guy in without fully vetting him personally, because I trusted the person who was vouching for him. This turned out to be a mistake on my part, and a lesson learned. As it turned out, the problems he was having in his last sober living was related to the manic episode he was going through that our mutual friend was unaware of when he brought him to my sober living. For the next 3 weeks the entire house was on edge. He was abrasive, intense, and was always trying to do things his own way instead of following the rules. Most of these rules were little things that we give warnings about, we give people a chance to correct them, and because he didn't break any major rules I couldn't just kick him out. I COULD have, but I wouldn't feel right doing it, for something so small. As time went on it became clear to me that this was not going to change. We went to great lengths to give him a real opportunity to make it work at our house. He got on the right medication and was taking it, we were giving him plenty of 'growing room'. When it became apparent to me that this was going to be an issue, I decided I would give him advanced notice that we would not be accepting his next months fees and he should start looking for a new place to live. After hearing this, he tried to turn a new leaf - apologize to people in the house, apologize to me, but by then the damage had already been done and the people were incredibly uncomfortable living with him. A week went by and I reminded him that his time at our house was coming to an end. I made it very clear, but it was obvious to me he was not fully comprehending it, he was in deniable about the situation. On the last day I figured he would try to leave the house early to go to work and get home late, putting us in the uncomfortable position of having an argument and having to kick him out on the street in the middle of the night. I decided I would have to talk with him before he left. I heard him stirring around 3 in the morning, I told him that today was the day, he attempted a rebuttal and I reiterated that today was the day. He finally accepted the fact, and took out all his frustration about the situation out on me.

While studying the Bible, I have found so many verses about God's unfailing love, His truths and promises, forgiveness, and strongholds that Satan has reminded me of for too many years.  I started writing these verses in a small notebook and when I am having a bad day, I can quickly find what I want.

Sometimes freedom it is not an instantaneous thing, but a work in progress.  To find it, I must study God's word and apply His truths to my life every day.  God's love and grace is so amazing.

Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling. Seeing his face when he picked up our son just put me completely his shoes and made me realize how much he is sacrificing. He missed six months of his child's life, I could not imagine. This was for sure an evening I will never forget and always cherish.","label":1,"set":"B"}

He was really friendly, like he had a good home at some point.  Wasn't aggressive at all, just being happy to have something to eat.

It's a government job, so your prior experience and reputation are very important in resume building and career advancement. It was a pretty memorable experience since it took about two weeks in total to complete. This included getting a background check, two rounds of interviews, contacts to all my references, etc. Additionally, they were panel style interviews, basically you sit there and 4 people grill you with questions. I also have some fear\/ nervousness in the sense that I'm not sure this is what I really want to do with my life and career, but I need to make a commitment to a job and stick with it. I'm getting to the age that I want to settle and get a house\/ wife\/ etc, so I need a stable job to support that. I think ultimately this event will be pivotable in what I hope to be a long and steady career. This event happened in the past month, however I didn't get the acceptance for the position until last week so this is all still very fresh in my mind.

This woman, in my informed opinion, was not so much having a mental episode, but was high on drugs. She did have some signs of mental illness. She was quiet and sweet, and just sat on the floor near our station counter, drawing artwork. On this particular night my Nurse's Aide wasn't there, and it was only me and the other nurse.

The next morning we hit the road very early. She wanted to spend as much time as possible exploring the home so we didn't waste any daylight. The home was everything we'd imagined and more. It felt like we were transplanted back to the late nineteenth century. There were reenactors dressed up like the Wilder family. They had all the old tools and machinery commonly seen around settler homes back then. They were doing ordinary daily chores like scrubbing clothes. We even got to see a settler churning real butter from cream. Then there were the animals. I think this was my favorite part. Seeing how the cows and other animals were kept and maintained was kind of a thrill to me. By the end of the day we were both exhausted.

It was my first time to pain on a street and the first time to paint a ten foot manatee. We chose the manatee because it is the elementary school's mascot. It was also a great way to get the kids involved. I learned about how to paint on the street and make sure it isn't easily washed out. This was a really great experience for me because I paint often. I am no master artist or anything but I think this experience has given me a huge burst of inspiration. I do not think I will start creating graffiti or anything but I might start using different tools. My choice paint is watercolor because of how delicate it is and soft and beautiful the strokes come out. It takes patience because what appears when you paint, and what comes out when it dries are two different images. What I love about painting the street is that it is easy to just make corrections immediately without having to wait much. This was a great experience that opened my eyes to new things.

I have been told I should really STOP now to reserve whatever I have left. I am using my walker at home now, so that is helping with my falling. However, because I used to be paralyzed from my waist down and spent years on my scooter, I do not want to have to use a scooter again. I donated both of mine. I also had hand controls in my vehicle, which I am afraid I might have to do again. I am okay with that aid. I simply feel like I am going backwards, even though I have known for the 34 years I've had MS it is a progressive disease. Now that my husband is retired and we can do things, it is so difficult for me, though I thoroughly enjoy travelling This new news about my MS has been emotionally and mentally exhausting.","label":1,"set":"B"}

I was a little worried how things were going to go because we hadn't been dating very long at the time and didn't know how we would get a long when we were in each other space all the time. We were excited to see how all this would go but first we had to get through the move. I lucky have access to a truck so we didn't  need to rent anything. My girlfriend had to work that day so i started the move solo. It wasn't to bad at first since i just did the boxes but that went by fast. Next I started with the heavier stuff with a dolly like the washer and dryer. Next was the chairs and desk but i was starting to run out of the stuff that i could move by myself. I picked my girlfriend up from work and we got a quick snack before we got back to our new place with a great view of Maine. We then started the move with the couch its not very heavy well at least for me but we had to lift it to angle it through the door. That part was very frustrating but we got through it. Next was the mattress. It was much lighter than then sofa but to angle through the halls was a mess and we started to snap at each other. I think we were both getting tired and started to take it out on one another. After we got the mattresses in though that was it and we both calmed down and turned from grumpy to relieved. Now that the move is over we have nothing but good times these last two months and i know we made the right choice to live together.","label":0,"set":"B"}

I did not sleep at during the night, I tried but I could not. My girlfriend has been away for three days now, I have been calling her in vain, her phone rings and she sends me straight to voicemail. I scratched my head several times those past few days wondering what I did wrong so I could apologize but I could not place my finger on anything, I tried to assume that being Easter Holidays she must have traveled to her home town. But why did she not tell me? Anyway, I got up and showered quickly and went and picked up my friend and on the way to the hospital he could tell something was off. I decided to open up since we rarely kept anything from each other, I told him how we had spent Christmas together with my girlfriend, for the first time I did not go home to my parents home to celebrate because I wanted to spend it with her, this was also her idea, she did not have to convince me much to do it, I was in love. My friend felt disappointed, he tried to encourage me to just hang in there and everything will be work out for the greater good, this sounded like Greek to me at this point, I just wanted her back. Halfway to the hospital she called, I asked her to call me back in hour after I had checked my friend in the hospital and was free to talk. My heart was racing all the way to the hospital, anxious of what she was about to tell me, were we breaking up? where was she?. Questions and all sorts of reasoning clouded my mind and I could not wait to hear what she had to say. Finally, I was free to call back. I dialed her number and an unfamiliar male voice picked up the phone, I apologized and hang up assuming I had dialed a wrong number, I tried again and got the same voice, I tried to contain my composure and asked him if I could speak to my girlfriend, his answer ripped my heart in a million little pieces! He calmly told me \"his\" fiance was on holiday and he did not appreciate me calling her all the time. I am safely back home now. I just have to rest my head and my heart! It has been a long and stressful day and there is nothing I can do to forget about it. I just hope that tomorrow when I wake I will be level headed and start my healing and moving on journey. I do not know whether I will have the strength or the courage to fight for this love. Only time will tell, I highly doubt it though. Matters of the heart are very complex, no matter what age one is. All in all, life has to go on and I have to keep my head high, I will try however hard it is. Maybe next time I will love with my head and not my head, there could have been red flags but I was too blind to see.","label":1,"set":"B"}

We all live in different parts of the country, so it is rare that we are all together at one time. We had a lot of fun with nieces and nephews who are growing up quickly. Our niece also turned 13 on the cruise, and for her birthday my husband and I took her bowling on the boat. She was so excited and happy to go with us. I will remember that moment.

When we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hotel also had a whirlpool! We swam most of the day and relaxed in the whirlpool for a while. We were both hungry after swimming all afternoon, so we decided to have a steak dinner. We both ordered rib eye steaks and enjoyed the meal thoroughly.  After dinner, we drove to a movie theater to see the remake of The Lion King, one of his favorite movies of all time. The theater featured a state of the art sound and visual experience called RPX. I expected a large screen and fantastic sound, but what I did not expect were the seats...overstuffed leather electric recliners that adjusted to just about every position imaginable. My husband was overjoyed at the comfort of the seats because he suffers from back pain and I felt so happy that I had chosen a theater that would allow him to see this special movie in such a memorable way. The sound was incredible, not even close to the sound experience in the movie theater we usually frequent. After the movie, my husband could not stop talking about the movie itself and the overall experience of seeing it in this type of theater. We decided at that moment that we would not wish to see a movie anywhere else, ever again.

While there was no one to do this work, I took it upon myself to do the weeks and weeks of hard work for no pay.   I think that doing good works for people without really asking for anything in return us honorable.  My cousin told me that he got a price quote for 1,000 dollars to do all the work.  My cousin had been sick a long time and inherited his father's house when he died.  My cousin has inherited a lot of wealth, but is in bad health himself, which is not a good thing.  In my opinion, money cannot buy mental health or sanity.  Moreover, it can be more of a burden, inheriting thousands and thousands of dollars. I spent so many weekends in the heat of the summer, doing laborious yard work over six weekends, that I lost 5 pounds. I spent my 15 minutes breaks, drinking Powerade and water during the eighth or nine hours per day that I cut down all the overgrown hedges and weeds around my Uncle's house. I also trimmed around the shed and elsewhere on my Uncle's property.  It was all work and no play at my Uncle's old house.  I did like the views in their town.  The sky was open and there were plenty of views of the mountains.  I guess that was an upside to doing the work.  You did get the fresh air of the mountains. Over the six weekends that I was tidying up the yard out front and around back, the neighbors were pleasantly surprised that work was getting done.  The one neighbor of my Uncle was on his riding tractor, cutting his lawn like everyone in my Uncle's small town tend to do.  In fact, they were watching as I took some time, cutting all the large branches and large plants that were growing near the edge of the neighbor's property.  The neighbors in town don't miss a thing.  It is a town with very little crime from the statistics that I checked out.  My Uncle's town was very safe, since everyone knows each other's name. These weeds had been overgrown for a decade, but it got the neighbor's attention -- in a good way.  The fact that things were getting done on the property and that I have a \"big heart\" and that \"God\" will \"bless me\" for doing this work was a touching moment for me.  My Uncle and Aunt would really have appreciated the hard I put in on the property, since many neighbors did.","label":1,"set":"B"}

The weather was unseasonably warm as I stepped outside to head to the gym to get a swim in. Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications. That of course didn't need to happen, thankfully. Maybe the shock of the cold water or the mild exercise induced labor, but as soon as I stepped out of the pool I felt my first contraction. I immediately called my husband. He rushed from home where he was getting ready from work to pick me up and take me into the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital I was immediately taken to a delivery room. The doctor I had chosen for my birth was thankfully on duty at the time and was able to come in right away. He checked my cervix and announced that the baby would come soon. The next few hours that followed were a blur of pain and hard work. I opted for a natural birth with no medication, and I'm glad I did. It wasn't fun, but I got to fully experience the wonder of birth. My husband was at my side the entire time while I squeezed his hand. Finally, at 11:01am, Cameron was born. He was a beautiful baby with a thick head of black hair. He has his father's eyes, and my button nose. The nurses all said he was the most handsome baby they had ever seen. After nine months of waiting, I couldn't believe that it only took five hours for my son to arrive. We stayed overnight at the hospital so that his health could be monitored. A breast feeding specialist came in to make sure Cameron was latching that morning. After that, we were able to head home with our new son.","label":0,"set":"B"}

Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it.

I did cry, but at least I managed to make it home before the damn burst. Luckily, Pete didn't notice and I just made it seem like my eyes were puffy because my allergies were acting up. I don't think it's fair to get him upset just now during his final exams, but I will tell him about it when things look brighter.  Pete maybe only 15, but he loves me very much and often takes my battles as his own. He can't always understand that, as a single mom, sometimes you just need to put up with stuff. So this past week I have just continued to do my job as usual and I have kept my head down and focused. I also tried not to rehash the moment with any of my co-workers because just reliving it gives me anxiety. I have started to look for a new job but the truth is that its a bit scary to just jump ship and I don't want to do that until the right position comes along. I need to pay the rent.

I wish I knew what he asked of everyone else but from me he just wanted to know about how I was getting along with the latest project, which I was happy to tell him about. Then, he totally surprised me by asking me if I was happy.... I have not been asked that by any superior EVER in all my 30 years of work experience. And then the damn burst. I stupidly let it all out...tears, snot and all. I told him everything that David had said about me and my supposed \"lack of cooperation\" and \"selfishness\" and how he pretty much implied that I would never get a promotion if he could help it.

I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, \"that was a long time ago, get over it\". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session. That I don't need to hold onto those any longer. I can let them go. They no longer have the power to affect me. Easily the most memorable experience that I've had this year.","label":1,"set":"B"}

I wasn't called, so I guess I didn't have to go on actual juror duty. That was true, and in the end they told us that they had enough people and the rest of us can go home. Well, at least we got paid for our time. That's that I guess. So I went home, and after 2 weeks they sent me a 20 dollar check. In the end I forgot to cash it in. I guess I just did jury duty for free, didn't I? Oh, well, my time was wasted. Not like that's anything new. But at least I know what's it's like now.","label":0,"set":"B"}

He had saved up some money but he spent it on Christmas presents for his family and friends. He had been working part time for a warehouse near his house but it was closed for the season and he had been out of work for a few weeks. He had tried calling his CTE worker but he couldn't get a hold of them. He went to the bus station to get a ticket to go to where his sister lives, but the ticket was too expensive.  He had no family or friends in the immediate area, so he didn't know what to do. I had worked with him a little bit at the warehouse and he seemed like a nice enough person. I had given him a ride home from work a few times over the past few months. I gave him my phone number, so in case he needed a ride. He kept my number and gave me a call. he let me know what his situation was and that he was not sure what he should do. I told him I would drive down there to see him. When I got there he was just sitting on a bench in front of the station with his head hung low. I greeted him and he looked up at me. I asked what was going on and he said he had nowhere to go and no money so he was scared and worried that he would have to sleep out in the cold that night. I looked in my wallet and had ten dollars  in there, which I knew would get him a night at the local shelter a few miles away. I told him I could pay to get him into the shelter tonight. I told him I'd give him a ride down there so he wouldn't have to walk in the cold. He smiled and thanked me for my help. When we got to the shelter, I told him to give me a cll in the morning and I would see if I could find him some part-time work at the farm I worked on so he could try to get money for a bus ticket or somewhere more permanent to stay.

This test involved walking on a treadmill while his breathing was being monitored by machines. We thought, ok, not a real big problem. In the days leading up to the testing we decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. We started cleaning our carpets but were not finished the day of the test. While doing the test the nurses were alarmed, canceled the remainder of the test and told us that my husband was NOT to do any more carpet cleaning or anything to exert himself. This caused alarms to us. We went to see the heart doctor who directed us to a heart surgeon. She immediately admitted my husband to the hospital for a quadruple heart bypass. This was a critical day for both of us, not knowing his chances of making it through the surgery or how life would be after surgery. I had to learn how to do the outdoor tasks that usually fall on the man of the house. I learned how to drive the tractor to cut the grass, and the worst of all was learning how to operate the snowblower to clear the sidewalks and driveways. I had to do all household activities for 6 months, however in the end I still had the love of my life and we continue to enjoy life together.

I had told my partner she was coming to a city about an hour away from us, but that I didn't have the money for tickets and that I was gutted that I would miss it.  It was surely going to a memorable tour experience, as she was playing solo in small, intimate venues which is unusual. The day the tickets were released my partner grabbed some before they sold out, took me to dinner that night, and told me there. I was so happy I cried in the restaurant! Anyway, the day of the show my partner was gracious enough to drive over to the venue two hours before the doors opened so we would be sure to get a good seat. We waited in the cold, I was so excited time flew by. The venue was a gorgeous old church, with the audience sitting in pews. We got some drinks and sat around for an hour, and then the lights dimmed. I almost couldn't contain myself, I felt as though I was going to burst. The artist came on, and immediately launched into my very favorite song! Which she never plays live! I was stunned, and immediately began crying. The rest of the show was equally as beautiful and touching. Her voice was transcendent, soaring into the eaves of the church. The experience was absolutely indescribable.

Sunny but clear enough to not be too hot or too cloudy, just a nice day really. The speakers were people close to her. One of her sisters spoke, which was to me surprising as she was someone I've never met! You never get to even comprehend the people that were close to your grandparents, their parents, their siblings, their friends, and to see some of those people pop up was great. I wish I had more time to talk to them.   I almost gathered the courage to say something. I'm not sure why I did not, a few people wanted me to, but I felt like what was said was enough. I know the relationship I had with her may have seemed distant to others but I knew it was closer than that. I think what I remember the most about the funeral is that there wasn't much crying. My dad didn't cry. My Mom mentioned that too, she wanted to hold back her tears because there wasn't many being shed. It wasn't that my grandmother wasn't appreciated, it was just that people remembered her spirit and positivity and we all felt that she was just going on to the next stage of her life.","label":1,"set":"B"}

They made their cases about how we never see each other, and we agreed it had been quite some time since we had done something together.

Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe.  Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, \"diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported,  as an individual,  as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.  When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded.

The separation I felt was immense. I had seen my friends go on these rides and come out unharmed and very satisfied, what was I afraid of? My closest friend gave me the nudge I needed. She said, \"Its fun because you're not in control.\" I couldnt wrap my head around that but it made me curious. That is how my love for roller coasters began.

I wasn't more than a few blocks from his house on that Sunday afternoon and my car got T-boned. Another car came out of a driveway into a main road from my right side and plowed into me as I was driving under the speed limit at around 40 MPH. My car spun around in traffic due to the impact and by the time I got my bearings I found myself looking at an exploded air-bag, a crumpled front end and my engine steaming smoke. I was disoriented and sore and it took me some time to realize what happened. I ended up with a broken arm and a concussion from the impact. For the first time in my life I had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. While things could have ended up much worse for me physically, it was still a scary incident and I ended up missing some work due to it. It turns out that the driver that hit me was uninsured and that ended up complicating things for me. My insurance took care of a lot of what I was covered for medically but my car was a total loss and the compensation I received for the damage wasn't enough to keep me form having to go into my own pocket for a replacement vehicle. Since the other driver wasn't insured, it wasn't surprising to me that I wasn't able to go after them for additional damages since they basically had no money or assets themselves.

Practice had become my life because achieving this belt meant everything to me. I went through my entire repertoire while filming myself. I wanted to see where I could improve. I took not and practiced what I needed.  At that point I felt that I had the discipline and skill necessary to achieve the rank. In the weeks leading up to this I continued to practice night and day. I felt muscles in my body that I didn't even know existed, but it all paid off in the end. When I receive my red belt it felt like a crowning achievement. To this day I'm still really proud of this and I plan on getting better and better in this amazing sport.","label":0,"set":"B"}

However, I am glad that we were there so that we could offer help. One of the driver's was in bad shape and needed help. Being aware of the fear and panic that can cause bystanders from stepping in and helping during a crisis, we decided to get out to see if we could help save the driver. We are not sure if the person that came up to us for help was with the driver when the accident happened, but apparently she was a friend of the driver. She was noticeably panicking and losing control. Based on experience during a emergency, I knew the best thing for her to do was to be calm and rational. I tried to ease her nerves and offer her reassurance. She was grateful and wanted to contact us later. That ended up not happening as there wasn't anything in return that we were in need of.

Before I could look at a map, nearby tornado sirens began wailing and my phone received an emergency text informing us that a tornado warning had been issued. My oldest son began to panic, but I hugged him and kept talking to him calmly. We waited until the all-clear signal was given and then went to the party. We found out that a tornado had actually touched down one block south of where we were located. It only caused a small amount of damage. Not long after we arrived at the party the storm dissipated and the skies cleared. Despite the frightening storms, we had a great time at the party. We all kept hugging each other and taking photos.

So after my usual day at work , which i didn't even  get a happy birthday from my colleagues. I was kind of pissed so i headed home immediately after work. As i got home i had a thunderous happy birthday and i literally jumped out of my skin. Tears of joy kept rolling down from my eyes , my colleagues where already there. My husband just made the story of having to travel and my kids were all smiles. I was really ecstatic , what surprised me most was my parents took out time to travel for my special day even though my mum was down with stage 2 cancer. I had series of gifts from my husband and my friends. The love showed to me was unfathomable. I really wanted to get a necklace which i saw at a store some days back and to my surprise it was among the gifts i received. I have never had a surprise birthday party before and this was a new and exciting experience for me. I love my husband but this surprise made me love and cherish him more.

She said she'd make it up to me the next day.  Rather than say \"yeah, no problem\" I went with \"I'm going to busy, I'm going to be naked on a bike in Chicago tomorrow.\"  She scoffed and thought I was joking.  That was when I decided, I was going to actually do it.I have a hybrid mountain bike that I use for easy trails around Illinois and pulled it out of my garage.  Checked it out by going for a ride around the lakes near my house.  During the ride, I saw a couple that I knew and we stopped and talked a few minutes.  They told me that they we also planning on going to bike.  Small talk, said hope to see them there and I continued my ride around the lake.Next morning, day of the ride, the woman I was supposed to go on the date with the previous evening text me \"Hey, are you mad at me? Call me\". Conversation ensued as to what my plans were for the night.  She then asked \"are you mad at me?\"  I responded with \"No. Can't be really be mad a mosquito when it's just following its natural instincts.\" She hung up.I get down to the park where we're supposed to meet at the \"secret\" location.  I get routed to a warehouse where there's about 100 riders all in various states of dress.  Looking around, I realize I didn't bring my water bottle.

I wanted us to do something special for her 40th birthday, so I took her to Universal Studios Orlando so we could visit The Wizarding World of Harry Potter! It was the first time we had been on vacation with just the two of us.  We had so much fun!  We stayed out late every night, and racked up over 30,000 steps on our last day in the parks!  Needless to say, we were exhausted at the end of the day, but it was worth it!  We got to ride all the rides we wanted, got to try three different kinds of butterbeer, and got to have ice cream from Florean Fortescue's.  Our favorite ride was the one that goes through the Hogwarts castle. It was like being right there in the movies!  Another good one was the ride that went through Gringotts Bank.  It was funny to watch the people jump when the dragon on top blew his fireball.  We made sure to eat at both The Leaky Cauldron and The Three Broomsticks.  Both had really good food, especially for a theme park.  While we were there, we heard that they're going to open a new ride that's based on Hagrid's motorcycle We will have to make a return trip to ride that one once the hype has died down.  Another of our favorite spots was the Dr. Seuss world.  It was fun to see all the characters, and they seemed to have some of the best shirts and merchandise. A really cool restaurant was the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium.  It's decorated in 19th century steampunk decor, and was really unusual.  Their ices cream sundaes averaged $15 each, but they were well worth it.  The one I got had a whole piece of red velvet cake on top of it!  We made sure to take lots of pictures to remember the trip. This was definitely a bonding experience for us that we will remember for the rest of our lives.","label":1,"set":"B"}

I was constantly on edge, thinking some nurse would come in to tell me he'd taken a turn for the worse.

When I got to the emergency room, I told the nurse what had happened, and filled out a lot of paperwork. Eventually I got to see a doctor, who looked at the cut, and decided I needed stitches.

Needless to say from the start of my entry, that is not what happened at all.   In all our years, this was the first time he took me home with him for the holidays.  We usually went to my family events because his parents usually traveled to Peru for the holidays.  Since his grandmother had passed, they had no reason to go this year. and his mother made all kinds of elaborate plans that would span 5 days.  He must have asked me a thousand times if I wanted to go or not, or if I would be comfortable with all of his family speaking Spanish.  I am fluent - he knows this.  But, I thought he was just being considerate seeing that I am the only white person coming - the only person who does not have Hispanic roots, period. I assured him that I was fine, and I would be prepared for a bit of a cold shoulder coming at me.  I was tougher than I looked.  We arrived at his parents home on the 23rd of December.  The house was brightly decorated inside and out, and it smelled of cooking  - you know how it smells when there are several types of food layered on top of another - but it just smells like home?  Yes, like that.  Everyone was incredibly gracious and kind, and I made a good impression by helping with cooking, clean up, set up and just having general conversation with his family - even his allegedly racist great uncle. Oddly enough, Devan seemed angry that they were warming up to me so well, making snide comments like they liked me more than him, etc.  Often, I found myself alone with his family members while he was no where to be found, or off in a corner messing with his phone.   We left on the 28th, and had plans for a bug NYE party in the city - tickets I had paid $400 for.  He called me on NYE at 8pm (and hour AFTER he was suppose to meet me) and said that he had taken me to his family's home to see if he could get their approval before marrying me.  He SAID they were only being polite and that NO ONE actually liked me, and he was sorry, but he just couldn't be with someone that they did not approve of.  I must have cried for a week, but eventually I began to feel that he was lying because there was no way I could have misinterpreted the situation that badly for 5 whole days.  I called his mother to ask if I had left my Hermes scarf there (I knew I hadn't) and she talked my ear off for over an hour, and said how she couldn't wait until Easter so we could be together again, and that she had told Devan she couldn't wait to have a new daughter - that lying imp used his family as an excuse!","label":0,"set":"B"}

The official cause of death was listed as a major heart attack. My grandmother and father both lived in my own at the time this happened. Both my father and grandmother were disabled and I am their primary caregiver. This event was very traumatic to my family. My grandmother was a very influential and important part of our family. My grandmother was the matriarch of the family. The day that it happened my father knocked on my door in the morning and woke me and told me that my grandmother was gone. I immediately jumped out of bed. The paramedics has just taken her in an ambulance to the hospital while trying to resuscitate her. My father was totally devastated by this event. He was hurt and emotional and crying over the passing of his mother. I tried to do my best to console him while also handling all of the funeral expenses and requirements. We had to call and notify all of our other family members about her passing away as well. It was a very difficult and emotional experience for our family. Funerals are very expensive and there is not a lot of financial help available to people out there.

{"index":1061,"Unnamed: 0":1061,"text":"So I don't go out much. I'm pretty comfortable being a homebody and just hanging out with my cats. A couple of years ago me and my now-husband moved from our home state and away from my family, who I miss every day. Every year my mom will come down to visit in the spring time. This year she came the weekend after my birthday in April with her fiance so that we could have a mini-celebration. I had told her that I've been wanting to do an Escape Room for a while now, and she found one in my area so that we could all go do it together. I was really excited because I LIVE for puzzles. The Escape Room was very confusing at first - as I'd never ever done one before - but once I got the hang of the process it was so much fun. My team consisted of me, my husband, my mom, her fiance, and four teenage strangers. We ended up racing the clock to the very last minute, literally. We were holding the book with the code to escape the room when time ran out! Surprisingly, the most memorable part of the event was the aftermath. My husband told me he loved seeing me that way. I asked what way? And he told me how my leadership skills and ability to put together seemingly insignificant details was something he didn't get to see in me all that often. And that's true, as a homebody I don't do a whole lot with friends. I don't play too many games. I don't really have a job where I can apply those abilities in my day to day. It was a definite reminder that I am a capable person when given the opportunities to apply myself. All in all, I had so much fun and I really hope to do it again sometime soon.","label":1,"set":"B"}

We went out to a really nice cafe together, known for having good vegan options in town. It was a really stressful thing, trying to find places that would actively cater to my friend\/my partner's partner. But, we found this place, and set out to go together. They were vastly understaffed, but the food was good and it was a quiet, gentle atmosphere. We took pictures together before we ate, and the meal was really nice to share. My partner sat between us, and we were all on a booth seat. We had a nice conversation and enjoyed the food. After that, we went out on a walk together throughout the town. It was a really nice experience, being able to be publicly affectionate without the worry of judgement. No one around here really knew us, we're just visitors. It's not like it'd have a lasting effect on us if they wanted to be upset with us for being visibly queer and non-monogamous. The feeling of safety and warmth of getting to spend time with my family, walking around, admiring the sunset and enjoying our meal together was wonderful. I will remember this day for a very long time. We had to go home that next day, but that night was one of the most memorable, holding hands freely in public, taking pictures, even being able to kiss in public. It was a nice feeling, that we rarely got to have, one that was set in a stunning backdrop of a quiet downtown and a cute vegan-friendly cafe. It almost seems like it couldn't be real, from how much fun we had.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"index":2777,"Unnamed: 0":2777,"text":"It was a normal day in the middle of the week when I decided to go to Santander Bank to withdraw some cash and then go to Wegman's. I was intending to go get some food, but it was also the only opportunity I had to smoke marijuana outside of the house. This is because I couldn't do it while my dad was home. So I went in my brother's car and drove through a small route I normally go for discretion. On the way I put small amount of cannabis in my pipe and smoked a little while driving. At that point I decided I should drive around and listen to music, then I should go to the bank. I took a long route around, and noticed at some point a cop car ended up behind me. I was nervous, thinking they might have known what I did. While I was nearing the bank, the cop car was still behind me, and eventually started flashing its lights. I thought I was surely done for, and as the two cops walked up after I had parked in a Barnes & Noble parking lot I thought I might have a panic attack. To my surprise, I was acting calm enough as they stated the reason they pulled me over is because the car was unregistered for a couple months. I didn't have up-to-date documentation and had to call my dad to get me a picture of proof of insurance, but it was surely better than them noticing any wrongdoing. Throughout the ordeal they didn't suspect anything, as I had hidden away anything suspicious and there was no smell. I was very lucky that day, especially considering I had illegal narcotics within reach in the car. I believe this will be the last time I do something so suspect on the road. At the very least, it will be the last time I smoke weed on the road.","label":1,"set":"B"}

I booked the airfare and the hotel. We were so excited to go. The trip was to celebrate different birthdays. we had two connecting flights that we had to catch. The first leg was awesome. As we got on to board the second leg we removed from the plane because the flight attendant said my husband had an extra carry on. He was carrying the bag for an elderly member of our family and he tried to explain that but they didn't care. We had to get off the plane and take a later flight.  It put a horrible taste in out mouth for the beginning of our trip. We put so much money into this trip that it really made me so angry with the airlines. We missed scheduled activities because of the delay. The part that stuck with me was how we were treated by the airline. It will probably be our last rip for awhile simply because of how we were treated.","label":1,"set":"B"}
{"index":280,"Unnamed: 0":280,"text":"Being talked down to by my older colleagues has been a constant theme in my career.   It's always seems to be the same scenario - they think I'm over confident.  About two months ago, I was given a peach assignment as a lead on a project.  I was so excited and energized while my colleagues were kind of resistent and downplayed the importance of the project.  They told me I was too optimistic because in the end the project would fail like all the other projects regardless of effort.  They told me it would be a big fall if I didn't come down from the clouds.  Instead of listening to them I started looking at the psychology behind their attitudes of impending failure.  I realized that they were missing the \"what's in it for me\" concept.  They saw no benefit for them to a lot of effort and hard work.  I saw this as a challenge.  How do I make them see their effort as a win?  How can I quantify and qualify the outcomes of their efforts.  I decided to make sure every project task completion had an outcome of reward both tangible and intangible.  I showed them how the effort and work they are doing benefits their customer, and themselves.  The reward of  successful completion leads to provable skill and knowledge.  I found the sweet spots of their sense of accomplishment and motivations and used it to garner their buy-in and support.  With everyone on the same page moving us toward success my colleagues were genuinely more helpful and excited to help me as a project lead.  In two months time the whole attitude of our team has changed.  They no longer see me as the young pup.  They h ave accepted me as a leader even though most of them are 20 years older than me.  I don't feel anxious and eager to please.  I have found their motiviations and I have earnestly tried to encourage and care for their successes as well as my own.  Last week I was able to provide a recommendation for a team member who intially had resisted the project because of her 180 degree turn around. Because of her changes in attitude she became a focal team member and will be leading her own project team soon.","label":0,"set":"B"}
{"index":4861,"Unnamed: 0":4861,"text":"Certain levels of stress at work can even be beneficial, since they stimulate us and give us the batteries. However, having too many responsibilities, giving account to your boss or a bad relationship with colleagues can lead to severe stress that must be nipped in the bud, either taking a while, or looking for another job destination. There is even the Burnout syndrome, which is characterized by a progressive physical and mental exhaustion, a lack of absolute motivation for the tasks performed, and especially by important changes in behavior in those who suffer it. There are great sources of stress from the family: we may live with a loved one who is not in the best physical or mental condition and we have to take care of him, traumatic events such as the loss of a family member, economic problems at home, with our couple or even if we have children, who behave in an undesired way. The best we can do in these cases is, if it is a serious problem, seek psychological or psychiatric help. Although not all sentimental ruptures are the same for everyone, the vast majority causes great stress and regret. Thinking if the other person has remade his life, stagnate, not be able to reorient our goals, stay locked up at home ... there are certain cases in which psychological help is also required to overcome this type of trauma. A change, a change of city, the own emotional break and therefore ending with all those daily and routine activities that made us feel protected can be important sources of stress. Getting married or having children also causes some anxiety about the future, since we can have negative thoughts about a new stage in our life. There is only one place where you can live and enjoy, and it is this present moment, the one you have here and now, if you let your mind go to the past or future, you will stress and it will be an unreal stress, because you create yourself with your thoughts. Whether in our circle of friends or in our own work, we can suffer from so-called \"toxic people\". The ideal for a bad environment does not cause us stress, would be to spend as little time as possible with this type of people. But as often it is not possible, because it can be a family, or at work where we have to spend so many hours, it would be good if the little free time we had would be fully enjoyed, in order to balance the balance of negativity that we have had to be exposed. To be well with others, first you have to be well with yourself to be alone. In the age of social networks, many young people feel alone or are too aware of mobile phone notifications, which can cause a high amount of stress. It is increasingly common to reduce the actual contact, by contact with the computer and other electronic devices. Years ago, people related more time face to face.","label":1,"set":"B"}

I saw people I had not seen years who loved her very much.  I helped my father through his own grief.  I helped him pack up my mother's things and sell the house.  I found all my mother's old diaries which was deeply moving.  My wife and I took in her dog which I knew she would want. The event also brought my family much closer together - not an easy thing as we are all so different and often do not get along.

But many of the guests stayed at our cousin's house so the place was cramped. Being the thoughtful person she is, our cousin booked us a stay at a local motel. At first, my family and I were wary of staying at motels. But we soon found out that the motel she booked was more of a family inn \u201a\u00c4\u00ee complete with a wonderful complimentary breakfast. The day of the wedding was hectic, as you could imagine. The bride was running everywhere \u201a\u00c4\u00ee followed by 3 or 4 of her bridesmaids and female relatives. The groom seemed relaxed (maybe he was good at hiding his emotions). The actual ceremony went off without a hitch. And the reception featured a wonderful buffet that I can see and smell. Overall, the trip was an overwhelming success.

{"index":8425,"Unnamed: 0":8425,"text":"An event that was memorable for me within the last 3 months or so was taking a licensing exam for my profession. The test was a multi-day event and had very tight security. It was nerve-wracking studying the day of the exam for the test and in addition getting through security for the exam was annoying. After I got through security I had to wait in a huge room with several hundred other test takers for the exam to start. The proctors read pages and pages of instructions for the exam which was very nerve-wracking as I didn't want to make a simple mistake that could mess up my score on the exam before I even started. Eventually, after what seemed like forever, the exam finally started. The questions were incredibly complicated but I kept going and kept trying my hardest on the exam.  The exam went for several sessions over two days. So before each session I had to listen to many of the same security instructions before each part of the exam. But it slowly got less nerve-wracking as I got used to the exam instructions. During each session though the questions were still incredibly hard. But at the end of each session I was happy because I felt like I had completed another big part of the exam. After the last session of the exam I felt so happy. I actually finished the last session a little early and was able to get out of the exam before a massive crush of everyone else finishing up the exam. It was so liberating to be done with the exam and have more time to do things other than studying and worrying about the exam. I felt great to be done with it.","label":1,"set":"B"}
